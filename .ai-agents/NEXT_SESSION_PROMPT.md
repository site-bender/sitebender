# Next Session Continuation Prompt

## Current Status

You have successfully completed a major milestone in the TypeScript codebase transformation project:

### Completed Work
1. **Conversion folder transformed** - All 4 steps applied successfully:
   - ✓ Arrow functions eliminated 
   - ✓ JavaScript built-ins replaced with toolsmith functions
   - ✓ Anonymous functions extracted
   - ✓ Object.is replaced with curried `is` function

2. **New toolsmith functions created**:
   - `isPositiveInfinity` - Checks for positive infinity
   - `isNegativeInfinity` - Checks for negative infinity  
   - `is` - Curried Object.is replacement
   - `instanceOf` - Renamed from old `is`

3. **Type system redesigned**:
   - `Value` type for all inputs (replaces `unknown`)
   - `Serializable` type for transmittable data
   - Optional parameters (`value?: Value`) to handle undefined

4. **Comprehensive prompts created** in `.ai-agents/prompts/`:
   - `named-functions.md` - Arrow function elimination
   - `replace-with-toolsmith-functions.md` - JavaScript built-in replacement
   - `edge-cases-exceptions.md` - Critical exceptions to rules
   - `transformation-checklist.md` - Verification steps
   - `jsdoc-to-envoy-basic.md` - JSDoc to Envoy conversion
   - `envoy-advanced-comments.md` - Advanced Envoy comments
   - `prompt-ordering.md` - Execution order and AI recommendations

## Important Context to Remember

### Critical Rules
1. **NO arrow functions** - Even `const f = () => {}` is an arrow function!
2. **Comparators are NOT curried** - Array.sort needs `(a, b) => number`
3. **Replace ALL built-ins** - No ===, !==, ||, &&, typeof, instanceof
4. **Use toolsmith functions** - Check inventory before creating new ones
5. **NO COMMENTS** during transformation - Envoy conversion is separate

### Known Edge Cases
- `sortByKey` is a comparator - takes two parameters
- Arrow syntax in TYPE signatures is fine
- Type casts like `(value as { method: () => void })` are acceptable
- Extract ALL anonymous functions (even small ones in logic)

### Cost Optimization Strategy
- **Grok** (free): named-functions.md, jsdoc-to-envoy-basic.md
- **Claude/GPT-5** (expensive): replace-with-toolsmith-functions.md, envoy-advanced-comments.md

## Concerns and Considerations

### Technical Concerns
1. **Scale**: 6,409+ files to transform across many folders
2. **Consistency**: Need to ensure uniform application across all folders
3. **Testing**: Must verify transformations don't break functionality
4. **Dependencies**: Some folders may depend on others being complete

### Process Concerns
1. **Grok limitations**: May fail on complex patterns despite being "mechanical"
2. **Toolsmith gaps**: May discover more missing functions as we progress
3. **Comment conversion**: JSDoc removal might lose important information
4. **Time investment**: Full transformation will take significant time

### Questions to Discuss
1. Which folder should be transformed next after `conversion`?
2. Should we batch similar folders together?
3. How to handle folders with heavy interdependencies?
4. When to do the Envoy comment conversion (after all folders or incrementally)?
5. How to track progress across 6,409+ files systematically?

## Next Session Agenda

**THIS SESSION IS FOR DISCUSSION AND PLANNING ONLY**

The user wants to discuss:
1. Review of completed work and prompts
2. Strategy for tackling remaining folders
3. Potential issues or concerns
4. Optimization of the transformation process
5. Timeline and prioritization

**DO NOT**:
- Start transforming any folders
- Begin Envoy comment conversion  
- Create new functions or prompts
- Make changes without explicit user direction

**WAIT FOR** the user to:
- Confirm the approach is correct
- Choose which folder to tackle next
- Explicitly initiate the transformation process
- Provide any additional context or requirements

## Reference Files

Key files for context:
- `.ai-agents/prompt-ordering.md` - Execution order
- `.ai-agents/prompts/*` - All transformation prompts
- `.ai-agents/data/toolsmith-inventory.json` - Available toolsmith functions (run `deno task update-toolsmith-inventory` to refresh)
- `libraries/toolsmith/src/types/index.ts` - Value and Serializable types

## Session Start

Begin by asking the user:
1. "How did the conversion folder transformation work out?"
2. "Any concerns about the prompts or process?"
3. "Which folder would you like to discuss tackling next?"

Remember: This is a DISCUSSION session. Wait for explicit instructions before taking any action.
