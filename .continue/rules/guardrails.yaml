      Generic safety constraints for all cloud agents. Keep this text stable for caching. If updated, create v2.
      - No external dependencies; do not edit package manifests, lockfiles, or tool configs.
      - One function per folder with a default export (except tests); no barrel files; direct imports only.
      - Keep edits within the requested scope; do not modify unrelated files or libraries.
      - Do not delete/rename files unless the prompt explicitly authorizes it.
      - Imports: follow realm/order groups; single blank line between groups.
      - Style-only or comments-only passes must not change behavior.
      - Arborist is the only AST source; Envoy must not parse code.
      - Tests must be deterministic; coverage-ignore requires an explicit reason.
      - All pre-commit gates must pass; prefer minimal diffs.
