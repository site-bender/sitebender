      - Handle all errors explicitlyâ€”no silent failures or swallowed exceptions.
      - Show user-friendly messages; log technical details separately.
      - Fail gracefully: do not crash app; preserve user data; provide fallbacks.
      - Use toolsmith monads (Result, Validation, etc.) for predictable error handling; do not throw exceptions.
      - For multiple errors, accumulate via Validation; for effects, prefer Task/Result.
      - Recovery: retry with backoff, fallback to cache when possible, degrade gracefully.
