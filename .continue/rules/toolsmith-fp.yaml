    rule: |
      - No external FP or validation libraries (e.g., fp-ts, zod). Use the toolsmith exclusively.
      - Prefer toolsmith `vanilla`/`lifted` functions where provided.
      - Use toolsmith monads for effects and errors (Result, Validation, Maybe, Task, etc.)â€”no thrown exceptions.
      - Prefer named function declarations over curried arrow functions.
      - Enforce immutability, single responsibility, and composition over complexity.
