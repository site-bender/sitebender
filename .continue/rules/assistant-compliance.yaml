    rule: |
      - User directives outrank defaults and habits.
      - Rules compliance is a hard gate; green tests are necessary but not sufficient.
      - Ask whenever not 100% certain about rule compliance or user intent—no assumptions.
      - No speculative imports/helpers or staged references—create everything you import in the same change.
      - Prefer correct, rule-compliant changes over minimal diffs.
      - Any deviation is a bug to fix immediately, not later.
