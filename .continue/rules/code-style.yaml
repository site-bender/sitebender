      Indentation & Width
      - Use tabs for indentation.
      - Soft line limit at 80 characters.

      Punctuation & Types
      - No semicolons.
      - Prefer Array<T> notation over T[].

      Control Flow
      - No for/while loops—use toolsmith functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.).

      Spacing
      - Spaces around all operators: `x + y` not `x+y`.
      - Object spacing: `{ x: 7 }` not `{x:7}`; space after colons.
      - Arrays: space after commas: `[1, 2, 3]` not `[1,2,3]`.
      - Function params: `(a, b)` not `(a,b)`.

      Trailing Commas
      - Always in multi-line arrays, objects, and parameter lists.
      - Never in single-line structures.

      Blank Lines (explicit rules)
      - No blank lines at the top or bottom of a block.
      - Insert a blank line before `return` statements.
      - Insert a blank line above and below any statement that spans multiple lines.
      - Insert a blank line between different statement types (e.g., const → if, if → return, const → assertEquals).
      - Group `const` declarations at top with a single blank line below the group (not above).
      - Add a blank line before help comments (`//??`).
      - Never more than one blank line in a row.
