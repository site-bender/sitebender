# Studio Dependency Whitelist
#
# This contract defines which libraries are allowed to use external dependencies.
# Warden enforces this whitelist cryptographically - NO EXCEPTIONS.
#
# Philosophy: Zero runtime dependencies keeps the codebase simple, auditable, and AI-safe.
# External dependencies create surface area for supply chain attacks, version conflicts,
# and architectural drift. We allow dependencies ONLY when:
# 1. Building the functionality ourselves would be irresponsible (parsers, crypto, databases)
# 2. The dependency is battle-tested and industry-standard
# 3. The dependency provides order-of-magnitude performance improvements
#
# Testing/infrastructure dependencies (Deno standard library, dev tools) are NOT restricted.

  # PARSING
  # ============================================================================

  arborist:
    - dependency: "npm:@swc/wasm-web@^1.13.20"
      rationale: >
        AST parsing for TypeScript/JSX. SWC provides 20-50x performance improvement
        over TypeScript compiler. Arborist is the ONLY library allowed to parse -
        all other libraries consume Arborist's structured output (Warden enforced).
      alternatives_considered:
        - "TypeScript compiler: Too slow (20-50x slower)"
        - "Babel: JavaScript ecosystem, not Deno-native"
        - "Custom parser: Irresponsible - parsing is hard, security-critical"
      security_considerations:
        - "SWC is Rust-based, compiled to WASM (memory-safe)"
        - "Wide adoption (used by Next.js, Parcel, Deno)"
        - "Active maintenance by Vercel"

  # ============================================================================
  # DATA STORAGE & QUERYING
  # ============================================================================

  pathfinder:
    - dependency: "npm:oxigraph@^0.4"
      rationale: >
        Triple store with SPARQL 1.1 support. Oxigraph is production-ready (used by
        Wikidata and enterprise systems), embeddable (no separate server), and
        distributed-ready (SQLite backend enables Turso integration for edge replicas).
        Writing a triple store from scratch would take years and introduce bugs.
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Apache Jena Fuseki: Requires JVM, not embeddable, heavyweight"
        - "RDFLib (Python): Wrong ecosystem, not Deno-compatible"
        - "Custom triple store: Irresponsible - SPARQL compliance is complex"
      production_path:
        development: "Oxigraph + local SQLite file"
        production: "Oxigraph + Turso (distributed SQLite with global edge replicas)"
        api_changes: "ZERO (Turso is transparent SQLite backend swap)"
      security_considerations:
        - "Rust-based (memory-safe)"
        - "MIT licensed (permissive, auditable)"
        - "Active development, responsive maintainers"

    - dependency: "npm:@qdrant/qdrant-js@^1.11"
      rationale: >
        Vector similarity search for semantic queries. Qdrant is purpose-built for
        vector search (not retrofitted onto relational DB), production-proven (used
        by major AI platforms), and provides sub-millisecond query performance.
        Pathfinder uses Qdrant directly but exposes abstract API to prevent type
        leakage into rest of Studio.
      alternatives_considered:
        - "pgvector: Requires PostgreSQL, slower than dedicated vector DB"
        - "Milvus: Heavier, more complex deployment"
        - "Custom vector search: Irresponsible - HNSW indexing is complex, perf-critical"
      security_considerations:
        - "Rust-based (memory-safe)"
        - "Apache 2.0 licensed"
        - "Industry-standard for vector search"

    - dependency: "npm:prom-client@^15.1"
      rationale: >
        Prometheus metrics ingestion for observability. Converts Prometheus time-series
        data into RDF triples for semantic querying. Official Prometheus client library,
        widely used and battle-tested.
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Custom Prometheus parser: Brittle, metrics format is complex"
        - "Direct HTTP scraping: Reinventing the wheel, no metric validation"
      security_considerations:
        - "Official Prometheus project"
        - "Apache 2.0 licensed"
        - "Minimal dependencies"

  # ============================================================================
  # DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
  # ============================================================================

  agent:
    - dependency: "npm:libp2p@^1.10"
      rationale: >
        P2P networking for distributed applications. libp2p is the industry-standard
        P2P stack (used by IPFS, Filecoin, Ethereum 2.0). Writing P2P networking from
        scratch would be irresponsible - NAT traversal, DHT, gossipsub are complex.
      alternatives_considered:
        - "WebRTC only: Requires signaling server, not truly P2P"
        - "Custom P2P: Irresponsible - security-critical, protocol design is hard"
      security_considerations:
        - "Battle-tested (powers major blockchain networks)"
        - "MIT/Apache dual-licensed"
        - "Active Protocol Labs maintenance"

    - dependency: "npm:@ipld/dag-cbor@^9.2"
      rationale: >
        Content-addressed data structures for distributed triple storage. IPLD provides
        canonical serialization and content addressing (CIDs). Used by IPFS ecosystem.
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Plain JSON + SHA256: No canonical serialization (key order matters)"
        - "Custom DAG format: Reinventing the wheel, no ecosystem compatibility"
      security_considerations:
        - "Part of IPFS ecosystem"
        - "MIT/Apache dual-licensed"
        - "Deterministic serialization (no ambiguity)"

    - dependency: "npm:@noble/hashes@^1.5"
      rationale: >
        Cryptographic primitives for DIDs, verifiable credentials, CRDT hashing.
        @noble/hashes is audited, minimal (no dependencies), and used by major wallets.
        Rolling our own crypto is NEVER acceptable.
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Web Crypto API: Limited algorithm support, not available in all runtimes"
        - "Custom crypto: NEVER ACCEPTABLE - security-critical"
      security_considerations:
        - "Audited by multiple security firms"
        - "MIT licensed"
        - "Zero dependencies (reduces attack surface)"
        - "Used by MetaMask, Ledger, major wallets"

  # ============================================================================
  # FORMAL VERIFICATION
  # ============================================================================

  auditor:
    - dependency: "npm:z3-solver@^4.13"
      rationale: >
        SMT theorem prover for formal verification. Z3 enables mathematical proofs
        of correctness (not just testing). Used by Microsoft, NASA, academia for
        critical systems verification. Writing a theorem prover is PhD-level work.
      alternatives_considered:
        - "CVC5: Less mature JavaScript bindings"
        - "Custom SMT solver: Irresponsible - decades of research, security-critical"
      security_considerations:
        - "Developed by Microsoft Research"
        - "MIT licensed"
        - "Used in safety-critical aerospace systems"

  # ============================================================================
  # AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY
  # ============================================================================

  sentinel:
    - dependency: "npm:@noble/ciphers@^1.0"
      rationale: >
        Symmetric encryption for session tokens, encrypted state. Same @noble family
        as @noble/hashes - audited, minimal, zero dependencies. Never roll your own crypto.
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Web Crypto API: Limited availability, not all algorithms"
        - "Custom crypto: NEVER ACCEPTABLE"
      security_considerations:
        - "Audited cryptography"
        - "MIT licensed"
        - "Zero dependencies"

    - dependency: "npm:@web5/dids@^1.1"
      rationale: >
        Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for distributed authentication. Official
        Web5/TBD implementation, W3C standard compliant. DIDs are complex specs
        (multiple methods, key types, resolution protocols).
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Custom DID implementation: Spec compliance is complex, security-critical"
      security_considerations:
        - "Official TBD/Block (formerly Square) implementation"

    ❌ DEPENDENCY VIOLATION

    Library: {library}
    Attempted dependency: {dependency}

    This dependency is not in the approved whitelist (contracts/dependencies.yaml).

    Studio enforces zero runtime dependencies except for:
    - Battle-tested infrastructure (parsers, databases, crypto)
    - Security-critical functionality (never roll your own crypto)
    - Order-of-magnitude performance improvements

    To add a dependency:
    1. Propose in GitHub discussion with justification
    2. Demonstrate alternatives were considered
    3. Document security considerations
    4. Get architect approval
    5. Update contracts/dependencies.yaml
    6. Regenerate Warden contracts

# ============================================================================
# RATIONALE
# ============================================================================

philosophy: |
  "The best dependency is no dependency."

  Every external dependency is:
  - A potential supply chain attack vector
  - A maintenance burden (version updates, breaking changes)
  - A source of architectural drift (abstractions leak)
  - A cognitive load (developers must understand external code)

  We allow dependencies ONLY when the alternative is worse:
  - Security-critical (crypto, parsing, databases)
  - Performance-critical (20-50x speedups justify complexity)
  - Specification-critical (standards compliance is complex)

  We do NOT allow dependencies for:
  - Convenience ("left-pad" syndrome)
  - "Enterprise" ORMs that promise database-swapping (never happens)
  - Frameworks that dictate architecture (React, Angular, Vue)
  - Utility libraries that we can implement better (lodash, underscore)

  This whitelist is AI-enforced (Warden) because humans rationalize.
  "Just this once" becomes "everywhere" becomes "legacy hell."

  NO TECH DEBT. NO SHORTCUTS. NO EXCEPTIONS.
