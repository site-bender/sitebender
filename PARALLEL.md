# Parallel AI Development Strategy

## The Problem

Multiple AIs working on the same codebase create conflicts:

- File collisions when editing the same files
- Duplicate work on the same problems
- Inconsistent approaches and standards
- Git merge conflicts
- Wasted effort and confusion

## The Solution: Divide and Conquer

### 1. Git Workspace Strategy

Create separate branches for each AI assistant:

```bash
# Main branch for integration
git checkout main

# Create AI-specific branches
git checkout -b ai/test-generator    # AI 1: Building the test generator
git checkout -b ai/toolkit-math      # AI 2: Testing math functions
git checkout -b ai/toolkit-array     # AI 3: Testing array functions
git checkout -b ai/toolkit-monads    # AI 4: Testing monadic types
git checkout -b ai/documentation     # AI 5: Documentation generation
```

### 2. Task Division Rules

#### By Library (RECOMMENDED APPROACH)

```
AI 1: libraries/toolkit/ (test generator + core testing)
AI 2: libraries/engine/ (reactive engine testing)
AI 3: libraries/components/ (JSX component testing)
AI 4: libraries/toolkit/ (additional toolkit testing)
AI 5: Documentation & integration
```

#### By Feature (Best for New Development)

```
AI 1: Test generator core infrastructure
AI 2: Property-based test generation
AI 3: Branch coverage analyzer
AI 4: Algebraic law detector
AI 5: Coverage validator and reporting
```

#### By Layer (Best for Full-Stack)

```
AI 1: Frontend components
AI 2: Backend APIs
AI 3: Database and models
AI 4: Testing infrastructure
AI 5: Documentation and examples
```

### 3. Communication Protocol

Each AI should create a status file in their workspace:

```markdown
# AI Status: ai/toolkit-math

## Current Task

Testing all functions in libraries/toolkit/src/simple/math/

## Progress

- ‚úÖ add/index.test.ts
- ‚úÖ subtract/index.test.ts
- üîÑ multiply/index.test.ts (in progress)
- ‚è≥ divide/index.test.ts (next)

## Blockers

None

## Notes for Other AIs

- Found issue with multiply function handling Infinity
- Created shared test helper in tests/helpers/math.ts
```

### 4. Shared Resources

Create a shared directory for common utilities:

```
shared/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-helpers/     # Shared test utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/            # Shared TypeScript types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants/        # Shared constants
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/             # Shared documentation
```

### 5. Integration Schedule

```bash
# Every 2 hours (or after significant milestone)
git checkout main
git merge ai/test-generator --no-ff
git merge ai/toolkit-math --no-ff
git merge ai/toolkit-array --no-ff
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin main

# Each AI then rebases
git checkout ai/test-generator
git rebase main
```

### 6. Task Assignment for Library-Based Parallelization

Given 5 AIs working in parallel on different libraries:

#### AI 1: Toolkit Test Generator (Claude - CRITICAL PATH)

```
Branch: ai/toolkit
Location: Main repo or worktree at ../toolkit-ai
Tasks:
1. Build test generator in scripts/test-generator/
2. Run generator on toolkit functions
3. Achieve 100% coverage on toolkit
4. Document the generator architecture
Primary Focus: libraries/toolkit/ and scripts/test-generator/
```

#### AI 2: Engine Testing (Claude or GPT-4)

```
Branch: ai/engine  
Location: Worktree at ../engine-ai
Tasks:
1. Understand IR evaluation model
2. Test reactive computation functions
3. Test hydration and SSR paths
4. Achieve 100% coverage on engine
Primary Focus: libraries/engine/
```

#### AI 3: Components Testing (GPT-4)

```
Branch: ai/components
Location: Worktree at ../components-ai
Tasks:
1. Test all JSX components
2. Verify accessibility compliance
3. Test Schema.org generation
4. Achieve 100% coverage on components
Primary Focus: libraries/components/
```

#### AI 4: Additional Toolkit Testing (GPT-4)

```
Branch: ai/toolkit-extra
Location: Worktree at ../toolkit-extra-ai
Tasks:
1. Help with toolkit test coverage
2. Focus on simple categories (array, string, math)
3. Write integration tests
4. Document patterns found
Primary Focus: libraries/toolkit/src/simple/
```

#### AI 5: Documentation & Coordination (GPT-3.5 or Human)

```
Branch: ai/documentation
Location: Main repo
Tasks:
1. Update documentation based on progress
2. Coordinate merges between branches
3. Run integration tests
4. Update CHANGELOG.md
5. Monitor coverage reports
Primary Focus: Root documentation and integration
```

### 7. Quality Control Checklist

Each AI must ensure:

- [ ] All code follows CLAUDE.md manifesto
- [ ] Tests achieve 100% coverage (or explicit ignores)
- [ ] No lint errors (`deno task lint`)
- [ ] No type errors (`deno task typecheck`)
- [ ] Atomic commits with conventional messages
- [ ] Status file updated
- [ ] No changes outside assigned scope

### 8. Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise:

1. **File conflicts**: The AI who started first has priority
2. **Approach conflicts**: Follow CLAUDE.md and TESTING.md
3. **Design conflicts**: Create a DECISIONS.md file to document choices
4. **Merge conflicts**: The integrating AI resolves based on tests passing

### 9. Performance Rules

To maintain speed with 5 AIs:

1. **Small, focused commits** - Easier to merge
2. **Frequent pushes** - Every 30 minutes minimum
3. **Clear commit messages** - Others need to understand quickly
4. **No large refactors** - Without coordination
5. **Test before pushing** - Don't break others' work

### 10. The Nuclear Option

If everything goes wrong:

```bash
# Create a clean integration branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b integration/attempt-1

# Cherry-pick the good commits
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Or manually apply the good changes
git checkout ai/test-generator -- scripts/test-generator/

# Test everything
deno task test

# If good, make it the new main
git checkout main
git reset --hard integration/attempt-1
```

## Success Metrics

With 5 AIs working in parallel:

- **Day 1**: Test generator architecture complete
- **Day 2-3**: Core components implemented
- **Day 4-5**: Integration and debugging
- **Day 6-7**: Run on first 100 functions
- **Week 2**: Full toolkit coverage achieved

## The Golden Rules

1. **Stay in your lane** - Don't edit files outside your assignment
2. **Communicate changes** - Update your status file
3. **Test everything** - Before pushing
4. **Follow the manifesto** - CLAUDE.md is law
5. **Ask when uncertain** - Better to clarify than cleanup

## Example Parallel Execution

```bash
# Terminal 1 (AI 1)
git checkout ai/test-generator
# Work on test generator core

# Terminal 2 (AI 2)
git checkout ai/toolkit-math
# Test math functions

# Terminal 3 (AI 3)
git checkout ai/toolkit-array
# Test array functions

# Terminal 4 (AI 4)
git checkout ai/toolkit-monads
# Test monadic types

# Terminal 5 (AI 5)
git checkout ai/documentation
# Generate documentation

# Every 2 hours - Integration
git checkout main
./scripts/integrate-ai-branches.sh
```

## The Bottom Line

5 AIs working in parallel can accomplish in 2 weeks what would take 1 AI 10 weeks, BUT ONLY IF:

1. Tasks are clearly divided
2. Communication is constant
3. Standards are followed religiously
4. Integration happens frequently
5. Conflicts are resolved immediately

The test generator is the perfect parallel task because it has clearly separable components. Let's build it together, but apart.
