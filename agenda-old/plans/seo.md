# SEO Plan

Build in to our compiler checks for good SEO practices, such as:

- Ensuring all pages have unique and descriptive title tags
- Implementing proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- Adding alt text to all images
- Creating and maintaining an XML sitemap
- Ensuring fast load times and mobile responsiveness

etc.

Pass a logger in so that a good log can be created and the visualizer component can display it.
