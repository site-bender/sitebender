# Accessibility plan

Build into our compiler checks for good accessibility practices, such as:

- Ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Providing text alternatives for non-text content
- Using semantic HTML elements
- Ensuring sufficient color contrast
- Implementing ARIA roles and attributes where necessary

etc.

Pass a logger in so that a good log can be created and the visualizer component can display it.
