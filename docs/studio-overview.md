# Studio (aka @sitebender/studio) — High-Level Overview

Memory anchor
- Canonical, machine-readable snapshot: docs/studio-overview.yaml
- If MD and YAML differ, YAML is authoritative for policy/guardrails and decision logs.
- Use the YAML to rehydrate assistant context after resets.

Studio is a Deno + TypeScript, progressive-enhancement-first web framework built from a suite of zero-dependency functional libraries. The system is architectered to minimize developer cognitive load while enforcing architectural integrity and accessibility. Documentation is generated from code; tests are generated by proofs where feasible; and the data model is grounded in a single source of truth: a triple store.

## Core Principles and Constraints

- Platform/runtime
  - Deno + TypeScript only
  - Pure ESM modules
  - No bundling; rely on static analysis and tree-shaking
  - Node compatibility is not a goal

- Authoring and rendering
  - No React, no VDOM; plain JSX (use `class`, `for`, etc.)
  - Everything works without JavaScript; progressive enhancement layered on top

- Dependencies policy
  - Zero dependencies across libraries
  - Sole allowed exception: Linguist (Linguist) depends on the TypeScript compiler
  - Testing and server-side infra (e.g., distributed systems, DBs) may use deps as needed

- Governance and structure (Warden-enforced)
  - No barrel files, ever; direct tree imports only
  - No re-exports (exception: explicit function aliases like `includes` → `contains`)
  - One function per file; named functions; export on the same line
  - Underscore-folder privacy; strict boundaries; no escape hatches
  - Contracts and privacy rules are enforced; AIs must comply

- Accessibility
  - Accessibility is a first-class requirement
  - Axe is integrated for automated checks (warn mode initially; hard fail before production)
  - Components enforce semantic HTML, allowable attributes/descendants, and ARIA correctness

- Enforcement stack (execution order)
  - Steward (style/shape, deterministic autofixes) → deno fmt → Warden (governance/contracts)
  - Goal: normalize code shape first to reduce governance noise and stabilize downstream tools

## Data Model and Flow

- Single Source of Truth
  - The triple store is the single, sole source of truth for data (data-centric architecture)
  - Constraints and validation live in SHACL and/or OWL2 (e.g., regex facets for strict typing)
  - Application artifacts can be stored as JSON/YAML/TOML/Turtle; Turtle/SHACL model expresses canonical semantics

- Authoring → Runtime
  - JSX → IR (internal, not exposed outside Architect except in the Workshop)  
  - IR → persisted artifacts (JSON/YAML/TOML/Turtle) for DB/triple store  
  - Architect.render(JSON) → DOM (no VDOM)

## Architect Runtime — Current Implementation Snapshot

- Build pipeline (client/runtime)
  - `buildDomTree(parent)(config)(options)` creates elements, attaches behaviors, and appends children
  - Special cases
    - `Fragment` handled by `handleFragment`
    - `TextNode` handled by `appendTextNode`
    - `Hn` maps to `H{level}` via `setLevel`
  - Attributes and dataset
    - `addAttributes(elem)(attributes)`
    - `addDataAttributes(elem)(dataset)`

- Behavior attachment (DOM properties on elements)
  - Calculation
    - `addCalculation(elem)(calculation)`
    - Attaches: `elem.__sbCalculate(arg?, localValues?)` (async)
    - Reads input: `value` for `INPUT/SELECT/TEXTAREA/DATA`, else `innerHTML`
    - Composes operators: `composeOperators(Operand)`
    - Writes output back to `value` or `innerHTML`
    - Dispatches `InputEvent("input", { bubbles: true })`
    - Tracks:  
      - `elem.dataset.calculation = JSON.stringify(calculation)`  
      - `document.__sbCalculators: Set<elementId>`  
      - `document.__sbCalculations[selector]: Set<elementId>`
  - Formatting
    - `addFormatter(elem)(fmt)`
    - Attaches: `elem.__sbFormat(arg?, localValues?)` (async)
    - Uses `formatter(fmtTag)` to produce an async function
    - Returns the formatted value (does not write back itself)
    - Tracks:  
      - `elem.dataset.format = JSON.stringify(fmt)`  
      - `document.__sbFormatters: Set<elementId>`  
      - `document.__sbFormatted[selector]: Set<elementId>`
  - Validation
    - `addValidation(elem)(validation)`
    - Attaches: `elem.__sbValidate(arg, localValues?)` (async)
    - Lazily composes on first call: `composeValidator(Comparator|Logical|Operand)`
    - Returns `Either<Array<ArchitectError>, boolean>`; Right is normalized to boolean
    - (No document-level registry here yet)

- SSR and IR
  - Minimal SSR helpers exist for tests; IR can be embedded for debugging (`embedIr.ts`)
  - Hydration/reactivity specifics will be finalized later (no VDOM)

## Library Suite (Current → Studio Name)

- `@sitebender/toolsmith` → Toolsmith  
  Pure FP primitives and combinators (monads, do-notation, mathematical laws); absolutely pure (IO isolated).

- `@sitebender/codewright` → Codewright  
  Accessible JSX components and DSL for semantic HTML, progressive enhancement, structured data, and enforced attribute/descendant rules.

- `@sitebender/architect` → Architect  
  Reactive computation core and render pipeline. JSX → IR → serialized formats → HTML/composed functions. No VDOM; SSR/SSG; minimal hydration.

- `@sitebender/formulator` → Formulator  
  Expression parser that compiles to Architect IR (and back). Correct operator precedence; variables/functions. Serializes beyond JSON (YAML/TOML/Turtle).

- `@sitebender/agent` → Agent  
  Distributed/hybrid data adapters (CRDTs, P2P, DID/VC, IPFS, Solid). Offline-first by default.

- `@sitebender/envoy` → Envoy  
  Documentation/observability from TS/JSX; HATEOAS docs; custom comment syntax (`//++`, `//--`, `//??`, `//!!`, `//>>`) with categories.

- `@sitebender/logician` → Logician  
  Test/proof generation: AST-based branch detection, property-based testing, algebraic law verification. Aspirational 100% coverage.

- `@sitebender/linguist` → Linguist  
  The ONLY library with an external dependency (TypeScript compiler). Powers Envoy and Logician; formal API.

- `@sitebender/quarrier` → Quarrier  
  Generators, QuickCheck-style property testing utilities, shrinking, and sample triples.

- `@sitebender/warden` → Warden  
  Cryptographically enforced architectural governance: contracts, underscore privacy, import validation, graduated enforcement, AI-safe.

- `@sitebender/steward` → Steward  
  Deterministic, non-configurable style/structure enforcer with safe autofixes. Runs before Warden to normalize code shape, reduce governance noise, and simplify downstream tools. Emits machine-readable diagnostics and pretty reports; targets ≤ ~2–3s repo-wide for checks.

- `@sitebender/quartermaster` → Quartermaster  
  Studio application generator CLI using declarative blueprints. Provisions app skeletons (e.g., mission-control, the-workshop) with import-map wiring and pre-wired tasks (Warden/Steward/axe). Supports flags for stack selection (Codewright-only vs Codewright+Architect), non-interactive plans, and dry-run.

## Applications (Dogfooding)

- `/applications/mission-control` → mission-control  
  Envoy-generated docs with live examples and structured data.

- `/applications/the-workshop` → the-workshop  
  Interactive sandbox: JSX → IR → JSON/YAML/TOML/Turtle → DB → HTML; real-time compilation and visualization.

- `/applications/the-agency` → the-agency  
  Experimental integrations (IPFS/Solid/RDF/blockchain) orchestrated by Agent.

## Roadmap and Priorities (Consensus-Level)

1) Warden (highest priority)  
   - Repo-wide enforcement; foolproof; stop AI-induced architectural drift  
   - Policy: warn in PRs; block on main

2) Toolsmith (next highest)  
   - Complete lifted functions; clean comments; enforce style guide; lock down  
   - Used everywhere, so must be rock solid

3) Steward  
   - Introduce deterministic style/shape enforcement; wire CI (PR warn, main block)  
   - Target ≥ 90% safe autofix coverage on targeted rules; ≤ ~3s typical checks

4) Parallel independents (after Warden/Toolsmith/Steward are functional)  
   - Quarrier (Quarrier) — generators/property testing helpers  
   - Linguist (Linguist) — TS compiler based parser  
   - Formulator (Formulator) — expression ↔ IR  
   - Agent (Agent) — CRDT/DID/VC/IPFS/Solid  
   - Quartermaster (App Generator) — blueprint-driven scaffolding and wiring

5) Dependent pair (build after the above are ready)  
   - Logician (Logician) and Envoy

6) Codewright and Architect  
   - Already far along; continue development with awareness that they’re more complete than typical alpha

7) Monorepo wiring and cleanup (ASAP)  
   - Import maps, pure ESM delivery  
   - Remove/relocate stale or confusing docs to avoid misleading AIs

## Accessibility Policy

- Axe integrated in CI
  - Warn mode until component allowlists stabilize
  - Hard failure before production
- Component-level enforcement of semantics and ARIA rules

## Import Maps and Aliases (Dev vs Prod)

- Policy: Use import maps for stable aliases.
  - Dev: alias @sitebender/* to local library src paths for short, stable imports and easy local iteration.
  - Prod: import the published library paths (no local src mapping).
- Example import (works in both modes):
  - import includes from "@sitebender/toolsmith/vanilla/array/includes/index.ts"
- Root dev config example (deno.dev.jsonc or root deno.jsonc "imports"):
  - "@sitebender/toolsmith/": "./libraries/toolsmith/src/"
  - "@sitebender/architect/": "./libraries/architect/src/"
- Per-package dev config (optional):
  - Each library can include a local deno.jsonc that maps @sitebender/* to ../<lib>/src/ to allow -c package.jsonc execution.
- Running with dev config:
  - deno run -A --config deno.dev.jsonc libraries/steward/src/check/index.ts
  - or cd into the package and use deno task when the package has its own deno.jsonc

## Release and Versioning

- Semver by package (independent versions)
- Apps dogfood local libraries via import maps (no publish needed for local iteration)

## Acceptance Criteria (Alpha)

- Warden: enforced; pass on main
- Steward: repo-wide `steward:check` passes; ≥ 90% safe autofix on targeted rules; ≤ ~3s typical
- Quartermaster: generates mission-control and the-workshop skeletons (Codewright-only and +Architect); correct import maps; Warden enforce passes; axe warn wired
- Playground: renders JSON-defined example without JS assumptions
- Docs app: serves Envoy-generated docs for key APIs
- Performance: validation ~< 5s repo-wide

## Acceptance Criteria (Production)

- Warden: block violations in CI and locally
- Axe: hard-fail with documented allowlists
- Privacy: no private boundary violations; no escape hatches
- Imports: no barrel files; direct tree imports; aliases allowed only as explicit function synonyms
- Docs: Envoy docs up-to-date with code; navigable HATEOAS graph
- Proofs/tests: coverage gate meets target; logician-generated tests stable

## Decision Log (additions)

- Steward pre-enforcement  
  - Decision: Introduce Steward as deterministic style/shape autofixer before Warden  
  - Rationale: Normalize code surface to reduce governance noise and simplify downstream tools

- Quartermaster blueprints  
  - Decision: Blueprint-driven app generator with import-map wiring  
  - Rationale: Deterministic scaffolding, consistent CI tasks, easier GUI integration

## Scripts Reference (for Steward planning)

As reference for existing (temporary/mediocre) enforcement approaches, see:
- `scripts/enforceEnvoyStyle/`
- `scripts/enforceFP/`
- `scripts/enforceImports/`
- `scripts/enforceNoReactJunk/`

These provide prior art for style checks, import rules, and React-ism detection. Steward will supersede these with AST-based deterministic checks and safe autofixes, aligning with Studio’s strict style guide.

## Items Explicitly Deferred (to future RFCs)

- Hydration strategy and lifecycle details (attach/detach, scheduling, event delegation)
- Reactivity model specifics (signals/cells/effects, cleanup guarantees)
- JSX transform pipeline details (TS compiler hooks, custom createElement/Fragment)
- Final IR v0 schema and serialization rules
- Accessibility allowlists finalization and gating mode transition

## Bottom Line

- Data-centric: triple store is the truth; JSON is the likely render input artifact
- Architect renders from JSON with no VDOM; behaviors are attached as DOM properties
- Steward normalizes style/shape; Warden governs privacy, imports, and contracts
- Accessibility and semantics are mandatory; ergonomics without sacrificing correctness
- Documentation and tests are generated from code and models where possible
