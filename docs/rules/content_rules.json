Extreme adherence can create awkward phrasing, but unnecessary splits can sound casual. Awkward infinitive handling can make prose sound either overly stiff or too casual. In professional documentation, this affects perceived credibility and readability. Grammar rules should serve clarity and naturalness—rigid adherence that harms comprehension defeats the purpose of good writing.",
