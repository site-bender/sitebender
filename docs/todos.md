# Studio Master Todo List

> **Current State ‚Üí Final State: The Complete Path**

## Philosophy

No timelines. No "week 1-2" nonsense. We work AS FAST AS THE AIs CAN CODE IT. This document tracks where we are and where we're going.

## Current State Assessment

### What's Working

### What's Broken
- ‚ùå Formulator: State monad refactor incomplete
- ‚ùå Most libraries: Partial implementations
- ‚ùå Cross-library integration: Not fully tested
- ‚ùå Documentation: Scattered and incomplete

### What's Missing

## Definition of Done

### For Each Library
- ‚úÖ All functions have //++ documentation
- ‚úÖ 100% test coverage (reported)
- ‚úÖ Zero Warden violations
- ‚úÖ Zero Steward violations
- ‚úÖ Contracts defined and verified
- ‚úÖ Integration tests with dependent libraries
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks recorded
- ‚úÖ README complete and accurate

### For Applications
- ‚úÖ Scaffoldable via Quartermaster
- ‚úÖ All governance passing
- ‚úÖ Accessibility verified (axe)
- ‚úÖ Declarative tests included
- ‚úÖ Documentation generated

### For the Project
- ‚úÖ All libraries interoperate correctly
- ‚úÖ Cross-library tests passing
- ‚úÖ Performance meets baselines
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete
- ‚úÖ AI can use it effectively
- ‚úÖ Zero technical debt

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- Zero runtime dependencies (except Arborist ‚Üí SWC)
- All tests passing
- All contracts verified
- Performance within targets

### Philosophical
- NO MIGRATIONS from legacy frameworks
- NO COMPROMISES on principles
- NO CLASSES anywhere
- NO MUTATIONS anywhere
- EVERYTHING is data
- EVERYTHING is declarative

### User Experience
- AI assistants can build apps easily
- Non-developers can create forms
- Distributed apps are trivial
- Testing is declarative
- Documentation is automatic

## The Anti-Goals

### What We Will NEVER Do
- ‚ùå Support React patterns
- ‚ùå Create migration tools
- ‚ùå Add bundlers
- ‚ùå Use virtual DOM
- ‚ùå Make compromises for "enterprise"
- ‚ùå Care about legacy codebases
- ‚ùå Add escape hatches
- ‚ùå Allow barrel files
- ‚ùå Tolerate technical debt

## Call to Action

This is not a roadmap. This is a MANIFESTO.

We are building the future of web development:
- **Declarative** - Everything is TSX components
- **Distributed** - P2P by default
- **Data-centric** - Applications ARE data
- **AI-first** - Designed for LLM development
- **Zero-compromise** - No legacy, no migrations

Every line of code moves us toward this vision. No shortcuts. No compromises. No excuses.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Formulator** - It's broken and blocking
2. **Complete Warden** - Governance is critical
3. **Parallelize everything else** - Multiple AI swarms
4. **Test everything** - Declaratively
5. **Document everything** - Automatically
6. **Ship it** - When it's PERFECT

Remember: We're not competing with React. React is already dead. We're building what comes AFTER the current generation of frameworks.

THE FUTURE DOESN'T NEED THE PAST'S MISTAKES.
