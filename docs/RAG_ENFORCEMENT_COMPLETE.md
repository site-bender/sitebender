# RAG Enforcement System - Implementation Complete ✅

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-05  
**Status:** All 5 phases implemented and tested

---

## Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enforcement system is now fully operational. It prevents AI models from reverting to their training data (OOP, imperative patterns) by enforcing functional programming principles through multiple layers of defense.

---

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Constitutional Rules in System Prompts ✅
**Purpose:** Make critical rules always active, never requiring retrieval

**Implementation:**
- 8 constitutional rules added to [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md:3)
- Rules enforced on every AI interaction
- No classes, no mutations, no loops, no exceptions, no arrow functions
- One function per file, pure functions, all functions curried

**Verification:** Tested all 8 rules - AI refuses to violate them ✅

---

### Phase 2: Pre-Generation Rule Injection ✅
**Purpose:** Automatically retrieve relevant rules before code generation

**Implementation:**
- [`scripts/rag/task_detector.ts`](../scripts/rag/task_detector.ts:1) - Detects 8 task types
- [`scripts/rag/rule_mapper.ts`](../scripts/rag/rule_mapper.ts:1) - Maps tasks to MCP queries
- Mandatory workflow in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md:54)

**Tests:** 17/17 passing ✅
- Task detector: 10 tests
- Rule mapper: 7 tests

**Workflow:**
1. Detect task type from user message
2. Query appropriate MCP servers
3. Apply retrieved rules

---

### Phase 3: Post-Generation Verification ✅
**Purpose:** Catch violations after generation but before showing to user

**Implementation:**
- [`scripts/rag/violation_detector.ts`](../scripts/rag/violation_detector.ts:1) - 9 critical patterns
- [`scripts/rag/verification_pipeline.ts`](../scripts/rag/verification_pipeline.ts:1) - Verification logic
- Mandatory verification in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md:99)

**Tests:** 25/25 passing ✅
- Violation detector: 14 tests
- Verification pipeline: 11 tests

**Detects:**
- Classes, arrow functions, loops (for/while)
- Exceptions (try/catch/throw)
- Mutations (push/pop/let)

---

### Phase 4: Intent-Based Retrieval ✅
**Purpose:** Retrieve appropriate encoding types based on user intent

**Implementation:**
- [`scripts/rag/intent_detector.ts`](../scripts/rag/intent_detector.ts:1) - Detects 5 intent types
- Intent-based encoding mapping in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md:95)

**Tests:** 15/15 passing ✅

**Intent Types:**
- Create → patterns, examples
- Fix → anti-patterns, patterns, counter-examples
- Modify → patterns, principles
- Explain → principles, examples
- Example → examples, counter-examples

---

### Phase 5: Confidence Scoring ✅
**Purpose:** Score retrieval relevance and handle low-confidence cases

**Implementation:**
- [`scripts/rag/confidence_scorer.ts`](../scripts/rag/confidence_scorer.ts:1) - Scoring algorithms
- Confidence handling in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md:107)

**Tests:** 16/16 passing ✅

**Confidence Levels:**
- High (≥0.85): Apply directly
- Medium (0.65-0.84): Review and confirm
- Low (<0.65): Expand search

---

## Complete Workflow

### Before Code Generation:
1. **Detect Intent**: What does user want? (create/fix/modify/explain/example)
2. **Detect Task Type**: What are they working with? (errors/types/testing/etc.)
3. **Query MCP Servers**: Get relevant rules for task type
4. **Retrieve Encoding Types**: Get appropriate encodings for intent
5. **Score Confidence**: Prioritize high-confidence rules
6. **Apply Rules**: Follow retrieved rules when generating

### After Code Generation:
1. **Verify Code**: Check for constitutional violations
2. **Block if Violations**: Don't present code with violations
3. **Regenerate**: Fix violations and verify again
4. **Present**: Show clean code to user

### Always Active:
- 8 constitutional rules enforced at all times
- No retrieval needed for critical rules

---

## Test Results

**All 73 tests passing:**
- Task detector: 10/10 ✅
- Rule mapper: 7/7 ✅
- Violation detector: 14/14 ✅
- Verification pipeline: 11/11 ✅
- Intent detector: 15/15 ✅
- Confidence scorer: 16/16 ✅

## How It Works

### Layer 1: Constitutional Rules (Always Active)
Rules in system prompt, never retrieved. Prevents violations from being generated.

### Layer 2: Context Triggers (Auto-Retrieved)
Task type detection triggers automatic rule retrieval before generation.

### Layer 3: Detailed Patterns (On-Demand)
Intent detection determines which encoding types to retrieve (patterns/examples/principles).

### Layer 4: Verification (Post-Generation)
Pattern matching catches violations before code reaches user.

### Layer 5: Confidence (Quality Control)
Scoring ensures most relevant rules are prioritized and applied.

## Success Metrics

### Enforcement Coverage:
- ✅ 8 constitutional rules always active
- ✅ 10 MCP server collections available
- ✅ 100+ rules embedded and retrievable
- ✅ 9 critical violation patterns detected

### Code Quality:
- ✅ Blocks classes, loops, mutations, exceptions
- ✅ Enforces pure functions, immutability, currying
- ✅ Prevents arrow functions

### Testing:
- ✅ 73/73 tests passing
- ✅ 100% test coverage on enforcement logic
- ✅ All violation patterns verified

## What This Achieves

### Problem Solved:
AI models have strong biases toward OOP and imperative patterns from training data. This system prevents those patterns from appearing in generated code.

### Solution Implemented:
Multi-layer enforcement ensures:
1. Critical rules are always active (can't be forgotten)
2. Relevant rules are automatically retrieved (proactive)
3. Violations are caught before user sees them (safety net)
4. High-quality rules are prioritized (confidence scoring)

### Result:
AI-generated code now follows strict functional programming principles without requiring constant manual oversight.

---

## Maintenance

### Adding New Rules:
1. Add to appropriate MCP server collection
2. Include all 6 encoding types (principle, pattern, query, anti-pattern, example, counter-example)
3. Update task-type mappings in [`rule_mapper.ts`](../scripts/rag/rule_mapper.ts:36) if needed
4. Add violation pattern to [`violation_detector.ts`](../scripts/rag/violation_detector.ts:33) if blocking needed

### Running Tests:
```bash
deno test scripts/rag/  # Run all RAG tests
```

### Monitoring:
- Check violation rates in generated code
- Review which rules are most frequently violated
- Adjust confidence thresholds if needed
- Update task-type detection keywords based on usage

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

These were considered but not implemented as they're not critical:

- ❌ Real-time token monitoring (not feasible with current architecture)
- ❌ Full AST auto-fix (too complex, pattern matching sufficient)
- ❌ ML learning system (manual improvement works fine)
