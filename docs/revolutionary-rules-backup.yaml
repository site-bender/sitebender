rules:
  - rule_id: RULE_FUNDAMENTAL_001
    category: paradigm
    priority: 10
    rule_text: "Write TypeScript, to the extent possible, as if you were writing Haskell"
    reason: "Haskell is the most beautiful language ever written. FP is proven better for reduced cognitive load, fewer bugs, and better parallel processing"
    consequences: "Writing imperative/OOP style creates massive technical debt and blocks progress for weeks"
    keywords: [haskell, pure, functional, curry, curried, immutable, composition, point-free, algebraic, type-driven]
    applies_to: [typescript, functions, utilities, business logic]
    philosophy: "Functional programming is not opinion - it's mathematically superior"

  - rule_id: STYLE_INDENT_001
    category: formatting
    subcategory: indentation
    priority: 9
    rule_text: "Use TABS for indentation in TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, JSX, and JSON files. Use 2 SPACES for indentation in Markdown, Python, YAML, and TOML files."
    reason: "TABS let end users determine indentation width (accessibility/friendliness). 2-SPACE minimum for clarity but maximum to avoid wrapping with deep nesting. Reduces cognitive load"
    consequences: "Mixed indentation causes git diff noise, editor conflicts, and readability issues"
    search_terms: [indentation, indent, tabs, spaces, formatting, whitespace, style, tab, space]
    scope:
      tabs:

        }
      incorrect_md: |
        - Item 1
        	- DON'T use tabs in Markdown
    philosophy: "User choice for display, consistency in storage"

  - rule_id: STYLE_CHARSET_001
    category: formatting
    subcategory: encoding
    priority: 8
    rule_text: "All files must use UTF-8 character encoding"
    reason: "UTF-8 is THE standard for text encoding"
    consequences: "Other encodings cause character corruption and compatibility issues"
    search_terms: [charset, encoding, utf-8, utf8, character set]
    scope:
      applies_to:

  - rule_id: STYLE_EOL_001
    category: formatting
    subcategory: line_endings
    priority: 8
    rule_text: "All files must use LF (Unix-style) line endings, not CRLF"
    reason: "LF has widest compatibility. Fuck Windows"
    consequences: "CRLF causes git diff noise and cross-platform issues"
    search_terms: [line ending, eol, lf, crlf, newline, line break]
    scope:

    philosophy: "Use the universal standard, not the outlier"

  - rule_id: STYLE_FINAL_NEWLINE_001
    category: formatting
    subcategory: file_structure
    priority: 7
    rule_text: "All files must end with a single newline character"
    reason: "Safest for file concatenation and POSIX compliance"
    consequences: "Missing final newline causes git warnings and concatenation issues"
    search_terms: [final newline, eof, end of file, newline, file ending]
    scope:

    category: formatting
    subcategory: line_length
    priority: 7
    rule_text: "Maximum line length is 80 characters for code files, no limit for Markdown and YAML"
    reason: "80 chars allows 4 files side-by-side on wide screens, readable on phones. Reduces cognitive load"
    consequences: "Long lines are hard to read and review"
    search_terms: [line length, max length, 80 characters, line width, column limit]

  - rule_id: STYLE_TRAILING_WS_001
    category: formatting
    subcategory: whitespace
    priority: 7
    rule_text: "Trim trailing whitespace in all files EXCEPT Markdown"
    reason: "Trailing whitespace is useless characters (except in Markdown where it means line break)"

    philosophy: "Every character should have meaning"

  - rule_id: STYLE_SEMICOLON_001
    category: formatting
    subcategory: punctuation
    priority: 8
    rule_text: "NO semicolons at the end of statements in TypeScript/JavaScript"
    reason: "ASI works perfectly. Semicolons are noise. Statements on separate lines (verticality is good) makes everything clear. Reduces cognitive load"
    consequences: "Semicolons add visual noise and are unnecessary in modern JS/TS"
    search_terms: [semicolon, semi, punctuation, statement terminator, no semicolons]
    scope:
      applies_to:
        extensions: [.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx]

    philosophy: "If the language doesn't need it, don't add it"

  - rule_id: STYLE_QUOTES_001
    category: formatting
    subcategory: strings
    priority: 8
    rule_text: "Use DOUBLE quotes for strings, not single quotes"
    reason: "Double quotes easier to see than single, avoiding missed end quotes. Reduces cognitive load"
    consequences: "Mixed quote styles create inconsistency"
    search_terms: [quotes, double quotes, single quotes, string literals, quotation marks]
    scope:
      applies_to:
        extensions: [.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx, .json]

# Migration Plan:
# 1. âœ… Export all rules to YAML (DONE)
# 2. Update MCP config to use BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
# 3. Clear existing collections (create new with 1024-dim vectors)
# 4. Re-embed all rules with superior model
# 5. Verify data integrity and search quality
# 6. Test MCP connection with new embedding model

# Benefits of BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5:
# - 1024 dimensions vs 384 (2.67x more semantic space)
# - 2023 vs 2021 (superior training)
# - 512 vs 256 token limit (2x more context)
# - Better for unique/revolutionary content that contradicts standard training
