# Getting There From Here: Achieving Automatic Rule Compliance

## Executive Summary

We need to evolve from manual rule enforcement to automatic compliance where Claude (or any agent) automatically retrieves ALL relevant rules for a task and follows them WITHOUT deviation. This document outlines the current state, the goal, the gaps, and a concrete plan to bridge them.

## Current State

### What We Have
1. **Qdrant Vector Database**: 80 rules, 14 forbidden patterns, 2 code patterns, 4 context items
2. **MCP Server**: Can store and search (though search is fuzzy and incomplete)
3. **Manual Enforcement**: User must remind agent to search rules
4. **Reactive Correction**: User corrects after agent fails

### Current Problems
1. **Agent Forgets**: New sessions have no memory of rules unless explicitly told
2. **Incomplete Retrieval**: MCP search returns only top 10 results, misses relevant rules
3. **No Automatic Triggering**: Agent doesn't proactively search before coding
4. **Training Dominance**: Agent defaults to OOP/imperative training when not explicitly constrained
5. **Context Loss**: Retrieved rules aren't kept prominent during code generation

## Goal State

### What Success Looks Like
1. **Automatic Rule Retrieval**: Agent automatically searches for ALL relevant rules before ANY code generation
2. **Complete Coverage**: Every applicable rule is retrieved, nothing irrelevant
3. **Persistent Context**: Rules remain prominent throughout the entire task
4. **Training Override**: Revolutionary patterns completely override default training
5. **First-Time Correctness**: Code is RIGHT the first time, every time

### Success Metrics
- 0% rule violations in generated code
- 100% relevant rule retrieval
- 0 corrections needed for rule compliance
- Reduced review time from hours to minutes

## The Gap Analysis

### Technical Gaps
1. **Retrieval Limitations**
   - MCP returns max 10 results
   - No way to ensure complete coverage
   - Semantic search misses exact rule matches

2. **Context Management**
   - Retrieved rules quickly pushed out of context
   - No mechanism to pin rules during generation
   - No rule hierarchy or priority system

3. **Trigger Mechanism**
   - No automatic "before code generation" hook
   - Agent must remember to search (which it doesn't)
   - No task analysis to determine relevant rules

4. **Embedding Quality**
   - Current embeddings don't capture rule relationships
   - No understanding of rule dependencies
   - Can't distinguish "must have" from "nice to have"

### Behavioral Gaps
1. **Training Override Failure**
   - Strong OOP/imperative bias in base model
   - Functional patterns feel "unnatural" to agent
   - Agent "corrects" revolutionary patterns back to conventional

2. **Cognitive Load on Agent**
   - Must remember to search
   - Must interpret fuzzy results
   - Must hold multiple rules while generating

## The Solution: Multi-Layer Enforcement System

### Layer 1: Enhanced RAG System

#### 1.1 Better Embeddings
```yaml
approach: Multi-vector embeddings
implementation:
  - rule_text_vector: The rule itself
  - context_vector: When this rule applies
  - example_vector: Code patterns that trigger this rule
  - anti_pattern_vector: What violates this rule

benefit: Multiple retrieval paths ensure complete coverage
```

#### 1.2 Retrieval Improvements
```yaml
approach: Hierarchical retrieval with validation
steps:
  1. Broad retrieval (top 50 candidates)
  2. Reranking based on task analysis
  3. Dependency resolution (if rule X then also rule Y)
  4. Completeness check against rule categories

benefit: Ensures ALL relevant rules retrieved
```

#### 1.3 Rule Categorization
```yaml
categories:
  critical:
    - FP_NO_CLASSES_001
    - FUNC_DECLARATION_001
    - FP_NO_MUTATIONS_001
  task_specific:
    functions: [FUNC_*, IMPORT_*, ...]
    testing: [TEST_*, ...]
    components: [CASE_COMPONENTS_001, ...]

benefit: Can verify complete category coverage
```

### Layer 2: Automatic Triggering System

#### 2.1 Task Analysis Pipeline
```yaml
trigger: Before ANY code generation
process:
  1. Analyze user request
  2. Identify task type (function, component, test, etc.)
  3. Extract relevant concepts (currying, imports, etc.)
  4. Generate retrieval queries
  5. Retrieve and validate rules

implementation: System prompt modification + wrapper script
```

#### 2.2 Pre-Generation Checklist
```yaml
before_code_generation:
  required_checks:
    - Have I retrieved rules? If no, STOP
    - Do I have all critical rules? If no, STOP
    - Do I have task-specific rules? If no, STOP
    - Are rules in my immediate context? If no, STOP

implementation: Enforced through system prompt
```

### Layer 3: Context Pinning System

#### 3.1 Rule Context Frame
```yaml
structure:
  PINNED_RULES:
    critical: [Always visible at top]
    task_relevant: [Visible during task]
    examples: [Code patterns to follow]
    forbidden: [Patterns to avoid]

implementation: Prompt engineering with structured sections
```

#### 3.2 Progressive Disclosure
```yaml
approach: Show rules when needed
timing:
  planning: Show architectural rules
  implementing: Show coding rules
  testing: Show testing rules

benefit: Reduces cognitive load while ensuring compliance
```

### Layer 4: Validation and Feedback

#### 4.1 Self-Validation Protocol
```yaml
after_generation:
  validate:
    - No arrow functions? Check FUNC_DECLARATION_001
    - No classes? Check FP_NO_CLASSES_001
    - Proper imports? Check IMPORT_* rules
    - Pure functions? Check FP_NO_MUTATIONS_001

implementation: Post-generation checklist in system prompt
```

#### 4.2 Continuous Learning
```yaml
feedback_loop:
  on_correction:
    - Log which rule was violated
    - Enhance embedding for better retrieval
    - Add example to database
    - Increase rule priority

implementation: Logging system + periodic retraining
```

2. **Automatic Triggering**: Can force rule checking via system prompt
3. **Reduced Violations**: Can cut violations by 70-80%
4. **Context Persistence**: Can keep critical rules visible

### What's Probably Achievable (60% confidence)
1. **100% Rule Coverage**: Might miss edge cases
2. **Zero Violations**: Some training bias will persist
3. **Automatic Learning**: Requires significant infrastructure

### What's Challenging (30% confidence)
1. **Complete Training Override**: Base model bias is strong
2. **Perfect First Time**: Some iteration likely needed
3. **Zero Cognitive Load**: Rules add inherent complexity

## Immediate Next Steps

### Today
1. Fix MCP retrieval limit (return 50+ results)
2. Categorize all 80 rules
3. Create rule dependency map

### This Week
1. Implement multi-vector embeddings
2. Build task analyzer
3. Engineer system prompt with automatic triggering

### This Month
1. Complete Phase 1-3
2. Begin production testing
3. Iterate based on results

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Success
- 80% relevant rules retrieved automatically
- 70% reduction in rule violations
- No critical violations (NO CLASSES, NO ARROWS)

### Target Success
- 95% relevant rules retrieved
- 90% reduction in violations
- 5-minute review instead of hours

### Stretch Goal
- 100% rule compliance
- Zero corrections needed
- Fully automatic enforcement

## Alternative Approaches

### Option A: Fine-Tuning
- Fine-tune model on revolutionary patterns
- Expensive but most effective
- 6-month timeline

### Option B: Guided Generation
- Use grammar-constrained generation
- Ensures syntactic compliance
- Doesn't ensure semantic compliance

### Option C: Post-Processing
- Generate then auto-correct
- Easier to implement
- Doesn't prevent initial violations

### Recommended: Hybrid Approach
- Start with enhanced RAG (this plan)
- Add post-processing validation
- Consider fine-tuning if needed

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Retrieval Still Incomplete
**Mitigation**: Mandatory category checklist - must have at least one rule from each relevant category

### Risk: Agent Ignores Retrieved Rules
**Mitigation**: Validation step that requires agent to list which rules it's following

### Risk: Context Window Overflow
**Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure - only show rules relevant to current phase

### Risk: Performance Degradation
**Mitigation**: Cache common patterns, pre-compute embeddings, optimize retrieval

## Conclusion

We can achieve 80-90% of the goal with enhanced RAG and prompt engineering. The last 10-20% may require fine-tuning or accepting some manual review. The key is making the system PROACTIVE rather than REACTIVE.

The path forward is clear:
1. Fix retrieval completeness
2. Force automatic triggering
3. Pin rules in context
4. Validate before output

This will transform the current anger-driven debugging into routine verification, achieving the goal of "DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME" in most cases.
