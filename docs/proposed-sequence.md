The proposed sequence is strategically sound.

## Proposed Sequence (sensical)

**Phase 1: Arborist → Quarrier + Auditor**
- **Arborist first** is correct - it's the foundation that Envoy and Auditor consume
- Based on your [✳ Arborist Clarification](file:///path/to/terminal) memory, Arborist provides the AST that Envoy needs
- The [✳ Auditor Audit](file:///path/to/terminal) shows Auditor is already partially complete but needs Arborist's output

**Phase 2: Envoy (with Arborist + Auditor ready)**
- Smart to wait until arborist/Auditor are stable
- Envoy needs clean AST from Arborist and contract validation from Auditor
- This avoids the contract violations mentioned in your [✳ Arborist Clarification](file:///path/to/terminal) where Envoy was importing TypeScript directly

**Parallel Track: Toolsmith → Pagewright → Architect**
- Toolsmith is "nearly there" as you said - the [✳ File Update](file:///path/to/terminal) shows you're already migrating Result types
- Pagewright and Architect can then consume the stable Toolsmith APIs
- The JSX → IR → JSON/triples → HTML pipeline you describe is the crown jewel

## Why This Sequence Works

1. **Dependency Order**: Arborist has no dependencies on other custom libs, making it the ideal starting point
2. **Test Infrastructure**: Quarrier + Auditor give you property-based testing for everything else
3. **Self-Documenting**: Once Envoy is ready, it can document the entire system
4. **Integration Points**: The parallel tracks converge nicely - Envoy can use the Architect's IR format to visualize component relationships

## Suggestions for Success

1. **MVP Definition**: For Arborist MVP, focus on TypeScript/TSX parsing with comment extraction - skip edge cases initially
2. **Contract Enforcement**: Use Auditor early to prevent the contract violations that plagued earlier attempts
3. **Incremental Integration**: As each piece stabilizes, integration test it with its consumers immediately
4. **Keep Formulator/Agent Isolated**: Good call - they're orthogonal to the core pipeline

## Is the Envoy Dashboard Worth It?

Absolutely yes, for three reasons:

1. **AI Wrangling**: Your [✳ Contract System](file:///path/to/terminal) memory shows AIs consistently violate contracts. Envoy's real-time monitoring would catch these immediately
2. **Zero Tech Debt Goal**: You can't maintain zero tech debt without visibility. Envoy gives you that
3. **Force Multiplier**: As a solo developer with AI assistants, Envoy becomes your "manager" - tracking what's been done, what needs doing, and where problems lurk

The December MVP timeline is aggressive but achievable with this sequence. The key is maintaining discipline about not starting Phase 2 until Phase 1 is truly complete.

Would you like me to help create a more detailed roadmap with specific milestones for the Arborist MVP?

Based on your project architecture and the dependencies outlined in your memories, here's a detailed roadmap for the Arborist MVP:

## Arborist MVP Roadmap (October - November 2024)

### Week 1-2: Core TypeScript/TSX Parsing Foundation
**Goal**: Basic AST generation for TypeScript files

- [ ] Set up Arborist project structure following your functional patterns
- [ ] Implement core AST node types (using your Result/Option types from Toolsmith)
- [ ] Basic TypeScript parser for:
  - Import/export statements
  - Function declarations (arrow and regular)
  - Type definitions and interfaces
  - Class declarations (even though you avoid them)
- [ ] Initial test suite using Quarrier patterns

### Week 3-4: Comment Extraction System
**Goal**: Extract all comment types per your documentation system

- [ ] Parse and categorize comment types:
  - `//++` (detailed descriptions)
  - `//??` (examples)
  - `//--` (tech debt)
  - `//!!` (critical issues)
  - Standard JSDoc comments
- [ ] Maintain source location info for each comment
- [ ] Associate comments with their code elements
- [ ] Test with real code from your Toolsmith library

### Week 5-6: JSX/TSX Support
**Goal**: Full TSX parsing for component analysis

- [ ] JSX element parsing
- [ ] Props extraction with types
- [ ] Children analysis
- [ ] Component composition detection
- [ ] Fragment and conditional rendering support
- [ ] Test against your Pagewright library

### Week 7-8: Integration & Polish
**Goal**: Production-ready for Envoy consumption

- [ ] Clean API design following your contract patterns
- [ ] Performance optimization (parse large files quickly)
- [ ] Error recovery (partial ASTs for broken code)
- [ ] Integration tests with Envoy's expected inputs
- [ ] Documentation using your own comment standards
- [ ] CLI tool for testing/debugging

## Success Criteria for MVP

1. **Parse your entire monorepo** without errors
2. **Extract 100% of documentation comments** accurately
3. **Generate ASTs that Envoy can traverse** for its analysis
4. **Performance**: Parse 1000 files in under 10 seconds
5. **Contract compliance**: Passes all Auditor validations

## Key Design Decisions

### Use Your Existing Patterns
```typescript
// Example API following your functional style
import { Result, Option } from '@sitebender/toolsmith'

export const parseFile = (content: string, filepath: string): Result<AST, ParseError> => {
  // Pure function, no side effects
}

export const extractComments = (ast: AST): CommentMap => {
  // Returns all categorized comments
}
```

### Avoid Common Arborist Pitfalls
- No mutable state during parsing
- No global variables
- Use your Option type instead of null/undefined
- Return partial ASTs on error (with error nodes)

## Parallel Work Opportunities

While building Arborist, you can:
- Have another AI finish the remaining Toolsmith functions
- Review and update the Pagewright library patterns
- Draft Envoy's data model based on Arborist's output format

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope Creep**: Resist adding "nice to have" features. JSDoc parsing? Later. Flow types? Later. 
2. **Performance**: Profile early and often. AST generation can be slow if not careful.
3. **Edge Cases**: Document what you're NOT handling in MVP (decorators, complex generics, etc.)

## Next Steps After Arborist MVP

Once Arborist is complete (late November):
1. **Quarrier**: 2 weeks to adapt for Arborist testing
2. **Auditor**: 2 weeks to add Arborist contract validations  
3. **Envoy**: Can start December 1st with Arborist ready

This timeline gives you a working Arborist by end of November, leaving December for Envoy's core development. The key is staying disciplined about the MVP scope - you can always add features after Envoy is consuming the basic AST successfully.

Would you like me to break down any of these weeks into more specific daily tasks?


Based on your ambitious Envoy vision and the systematic approach you've outlined, here's a comprehensive roadmap for your Arborist MVP and beyond:

    Arborist --> Auditor
    Arborist --> Envoy
    Toolsmith --> Pagewright
    Toolsmith --> Architect
    Pagewright --> Architect
    Auditor --> Envoy
    Architect --> Envoy
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

**1. Arborist Complexity**
- Start with TypeScript only, add TSX later if needed
- Use battle-tested parsing library vs. rolling your own
- Focus on common patterns first, edge cases later

**2. Time Constraints**
- Define "done" clearly for each phase
- Use AI assistants for boilerplate/tests
- Dogfood early - use Arborist on its own codebase

**3. Integration Challenges**
- Define contracts between systems early
- Use Auditor to validate interfaces
- Keep APIs minimal and focused

## Weekly Checkpoints

**Every Friday:**
- Run Arborist on its own codebase
- Check memory usage trends
- Review parsing accuracy
- Update progress dashboard
- Adjust timeline if needed

## Post-MVP Roadmap Preview

**January 2025: Quarrier + Auditor Polish**
- Property-based testing framework
- Contract validation system
- Test generation from types

**February 2025: Envoy Core**
- In-memory graph database
- Basic metrics dashboard
- File watching system
- WebSocket updates

**March 2025: Envoy Visualizations**
- Dependency graphs
- Complexity heatmaps

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Set up Arborist project structure** with proper module boundaries
2. **Choose parsing technology** (tree-sitter recommended for performance)
3. **Define AST types** in TypeScript with strict interfaces
4. **Create first test file** - parse Arborist's own index.ts
5. **Set up GitHub issues** for each week's deliverables

This roadmap gives you concrete milestones while maintaining flexibility. The key is staying disciplined about scope - Arborist doesn't need to be perfect, just good enough to unblock Envoy.

Remember your own wisdom from the [On being wrong](file:///Users/username/path/to/obsidian) note: "Being wrong more often ironically means you end up being more right more often." Ship the MVP, learn from it, iterate. Don't let perfect parsing be the enemy of good-enough insights.

## Parallel Work Rules to Avoid Conflicts

1. **Separate Libraries**: Each AI works on different libraries (Arborist, Toolsmith, Pagewright, etc.)
2. **Interface First**: Define interfaces before implementation
3. **No Shared Files**: AIs shouldn't edit the same files
4. **Contract Boundaries**: Use Auditor contracts to define boundaries
5. **Daily Sync Points**: Share progress and interfaces daily

## Critical Path Items

These must be done in sequence:
1. Arborist AST types → Arborist implementation → Envoy consumption
2. Toolsmith Result/Option → Used by all other libraries  
3. Quarrier basics → Property tests for everything
4. Auditor contracts → Validation for all components

## Risk Management

1. **Weekly Reviews**: Every Friday, assess progress and adjust
2. **Scope Creep**: Maintain a "post-MVP" list for features
3. **Integration Issues**: Test integration points early and often
4. **Performance**: Profile continuously, don't wait until end

This roadmap gives you a working Envoy MVP by end of December, with multiple AIs able to work in parallel without stepping on each other. The key is maintaining clear boundaries between work streams and having well-defined interfaces between components.
