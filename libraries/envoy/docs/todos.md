# Envoy Implementation Plan

**Target: Spring 2025** (3 months, achievable in 6 weeks with focused AI swarms)

## Overview

Transform Envoy from a collection of AST analyzers and comment parsers into a complete project intelligence platform that creates living documentation, real-time observability, and developer experience optimization.

## Critical Dependency: Arborist

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Envoy gets ALL AST data from Arborist. No TypeScript compiler imports. Ever. This is enforced by Warden contracts. Violations will be caught and rejected.

```typescript
// The ONLY way Envoy gets AST data:
import parseFileWithCompiler from "@sitebender/arborist/parseFileWithCompiler/index.ts"
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Graph complexity**: Use proven algorithms, optimize queries
- **Performance issues**: Lazy loading, incremental updates
- **Arborist integration**: Clear contracts, version pinning
- **Visualization performance**: WebGL, virtualization

### Integration Risks

- **Breaking Arborist contract**: Warden enforcement, testing
- **Dashboard complexity**: Progressive enhancement
- **Triple store setup**: Docker containers, managed service

### Timeline Risks

- **Scope creep**: Core features first, enhance later
- **AI coordination**: Daily sync, clear ownership
- **Testing delays**: Test-driven development

## Critical Rules for AI Swarms

1. **NEVER import TypeScript compiler** - Only use Arborist
2. **Follow Warden rules** - One function per file, no barrels
3. **Respect the contract** - Arborist provides AST, Envoy documents
4. **Truth over assumptions** - Code is truth, comments enhance
5. **Test everything** - No feature without tests
6. **Document everything** - Use Envoy's own comment system

## Order of Implementation Priority

1. **Comment parser completion** (enables everything)
2. **Arborist integration** (required for all analysis)
3. **Basic documentation** (immediate value)
4. **Knowledge graph** (foundation for intelligence)
5. **Dashboard** (visibility into system)
6. **Visualizations** (understanding at scale)
7. **AI features** (enhancement layer)

## Integration Dependencies

### Required from Other Libraries

- **Arborist**: AST parsing, metadata, comment extraction
- **Toolsmith**: Functional utilities, Either/Result types
- **Warden**: Contract enforcement, architectural governance

### Provided to Other Libraries

- **Mission Control**: Documentation and dashboards
- **The Workshop**: Interactive documentation examples
- **Auditor**: Documentation for generated tests

## The Vision

By Spring 2025, a developer can:

1. Add smart comments to their code
2. Get complete, always-current documentation
3. See their entire codebase as a navigable graph
4. Track every aspect of development
5. Measure and improve developer happiness
6. Query their code with natural language

This isn't incremental improvement. This is **revolutionary project intelligence**.

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Alpha (Weeks 1-2)

- Core documentation generation
- Basic comment parsing
- Simple markdown output

### Phase 2: Beta (Weeks 3-4)

- Knowledge graph functional
- Dashboard operational
- Visualizations working

### Phase 3: Production (Post Week 4)

- All features stable
- Performance optimized
- Documentation complete

## Notes for Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

- Use streaming for large codebases
- Implement incremental updates
- Cache everything cacheable
- Optimize for read-heavy workloads
- Design for horizontal scaling

### Technology Stack

- **Parser**: Via Arborist only
- **Graph**: Apache Jena Fuseki
- **Dashboard**: WebSockets + Web Components
- **Visualizations**: D3.js + Three.js
- **Storage**: IndexedDB + server cache

### Development Workflow

1. Write tests first
2. Implement feature
3. Add Envoy comments
4. Generate documentation
5. Verify in dashboard
6. Measure performance

## Questions to Resolve

1. How to handle very large codebases (> 100k files)?
2. Should dashboard be separate package or included?
3. How to handle private code in public documentation?
4. What's the versioning strategy for documentation?
5. How to integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines?
6. Should we support other languages beyond TypeScript/JSX?
7. How to handle monorepo structures?
8. What's the strategy for incremental updates?

## Final Note

This plan transforms Envoy from a documentation tool into a **complete project intelligence platform**. The combination of smart comments, automated analysis, knowledge graphs, and developer experience tracking will revolutionize how teams understand and improve their codebases.

Let's build the future of development intelligence. The developers deserve it.
