## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **CRDT complexity**: Use proven algorithms, extensive testing
- **Network unreliability**: Multiple transport fallbacks
- **Browser limitations**: Graceful degradation
- **Performance issues**: Lazy loading, virtual scrolling

### Integration Risks
- **Architect coupling**: Clean interfaces, minimal dependencies
- **JSX transformation**: Reuse Architect's pipeline
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep**: Core features first, enhance later
- **AI coordination**: Daily sync, clear ownership
- **Testing delays**: Test-driven development

## Notes for AI Swarms

1. **Use existing implementations** where possible (don't reinvent)
2. **Follow Sitebender patterns** from other libraries
3. **Maintain zero dependencies** except for protocol adapters
4. **Every function in its own file** per Warden rules
5. **Pure functions only** where possible
6. **Document everything** with JSDoc and examples
7. **Test everything** with property-based tests via Quarrier

## Order of Implementation Priority

1. **Core JSX architecture** (enables everything else)
2. **Basic CRDTs** (Counter, LWWRegister, ORSet)
3. **Local storage** (IndexedDB)
4. **Simple P2P** (WebSocket transport)
5. **Basic sync** (state-based)
6. **DID:Key** (simplest identity)
7. **Expand from there** in parallel

## The Vision

By Christmas 2024, a developer can:

1. Write a distributed app entirely in JSX
2. Have it work offline automatically
3. Sync with peers without servers
4. Own their data completely
5. Build in hours what used to take months

This isn't incremental improvement. This is **revolution**.

Let's build the future. The people deserve it.
