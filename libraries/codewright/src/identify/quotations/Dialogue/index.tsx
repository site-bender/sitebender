/**
 * Dialogue component
 *
 * Renders spoken text with speaker attribution using the q element.
 * Includes data attributes for speaker, mood, and tone to enable
 * rich styling and semantic meaning. Unlike Irony/Sarcasm which
 * mark the emotional intent of any text, Dialogue specifically
 * marks spoken words with their delivery context.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * <Dialogue
 *   speaker="Hamlet"
 *   mood="melancholic"
 *   tone="philosophical"
 * >
 *   To be, or not to be, that is the question
 * </Dialogue>
