/**
 * Variable component

 * Renders a mathematical variable in an i element. Can include
 * an href to link to an explanation.
 *
 * TODO: Should this use MathML or a var element instead of an i?
 * What metadata is appropriate for this, e.g., geometric system?
 * Units of measurement?
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * <Variable>x</Variable>
