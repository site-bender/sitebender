## User

Read [@studio-overview.yaml](file:///Users/guy/Workspace/@sitebender/sitebender/docs/studio-overview.yaml) carefully for an overview of the project. Then read the [@README.md](file:///Users/guy/Workspace/@sitebender/sitebender/libraries/quartermaster/README.md) and [@plan.yaml](file:///Users/guy/Workspace/@sitebender/sitebender/libraries/quartermaster/docs/plan.yaml) to see what the plan is for Quartermaster. We are only planning here. Write nothing yet.

The issue with the Qm documents is that the folder hierarchy described in Generated Application Structure is wrong.

First, there should be a `.sitebender` folder. Everything the user does not need to see or touch (autogenerated things) belongs in there, so `certs`, `contracts`, maybe `blueprints` (accessed via AI or UI), and `tests` (tests/proofs autogenerated by Auditor and Quarrier).

Then there is no `public`. I believe we use `assets`. And unsure about whether `src` is worth it or just put folders at top level. NOTE: I don't give a shit about how other people do it.

There is no routes. That's an implementation detail. What we want are folders for the different libraries, essentially, but named with what they do.

So we can discuss this in more detail. Check the documentation in the Architect and Pagewright libraries for examples. Then report what you found and understand and we'll go from there. Deal?

## Assistant

I'll read these documents carefully to understand the project structure and then investigate the folder hierarchies in Architect and Pagewright libraries.

  description: >
    Revolutionary web framework where everything is data. Applications compile to RDF triples,
    persist in semantic stores, distribute via CRDTs, and render directly to DOM. Zero runtime
    dependencies, pure functional programming, distributed by default. No migrations from legacy
    frameworks—this is for building the future, not patching the past.
  status: "production-ready for greenfield"
  philosophy: "The future doesn't need the past's mistakes"

  achievements:
    - Applications as data: Complete implementation
    - Distributed by default: CRDTs, P2P, offline-first working
    - Cryptographic governance: Warden enforces architecture
    - Mathematical verification: Auditor proves correctness
    - Zero dependencies: Only Arborist uses deno_ast (which uses SWC internally)
    - Declarative testing: Tests are data in triple store

# Quartermaster: Application Generator & Orchestrator

> **Voice-guided, collaborative application scaffolding with production-quality development infrastructure from day one**

Quartermaster is Studio's intelligent application generator that creates complete, production-ready applications from declarative blueprints. Unlike traditional scaffolding tools that copy templates, Quartermaster understands Studio's architecture and generates properly wired applications with governance, testing, accessibility, HTTPS development server, and time-travel debugging built in from the start.

## Philosophy

**Applications as data, generated through conversation.**

Quartermaster bridges the gap between intent and implementation:

- **You describe** what you're building (voice or GUI)
- **AI guides** you through configuration decisions
- **Quartermaster generates** complete Studio applications
- **Blueprints live** in triple stores as structured data
- **Time-travel tracks** every decision for perfect auditability

This is not just code generation—it's **application orchestration**. Quartermaster is itself a Studio application that generates Studio applications, embodying the "code as data" philosophy at every level.

## Target Audience

Quartermaster democratizes application development for:

- **Designers** - Build interactive prototypes that become production apps
- **UX Engineers** - Convert wireframes directly to working applications
- **Hobbyists** - Create sophisticated apps without deep technical knowledge
- **Small Business Owners** - Launch web applications without hiring developers
- **Bloggers & Content Creators** - Publish with semantic markup and accessibility
- **Architects** - Prototype distributed systems with real infrastructure

**Greenfield projects only**. Quartermaster is for building the future, not migrating the past.

## Core Features

### 1. Voice-Controlled Setup

Describe your application naturally, and Quartermaster guides you through configuration:

```bash
# Start voice-guided generation
qm new --voice

# AI conversation:
AI: "What would you like to build?"
You: "A blog with real-time comments and authentication"
AI: "I'll set up a blog blueprint with Sentinel authentication and
     Operator for real-time updates. Should comments be editable?"
You: "Yes, and I want markdown support"
AI: "Great! Adding markdown processing and edit capabilities..."
```

Voice interface includes:

- Natural language blueprint configuration
- Context-aware suggestions from Envoy knowledge graph
- Educational explanations of architectural choices
- Accessibility for developers with visual impairments
- Hands-free workflow for designers working in visual tools

**Why voice-first?** The immediate future of development is conversational. Quartermaster makes expertise accessible through dialogue, not documentation.

### 2. Multi-Modal Interface

Choose your preferred interaction style:

#### Voice Interface (Primary)

- Conversational blueprint configuration
- AI-guided decision making
- Hands-free operation
- Natural language intent capture

#### Visual GUI (Web-First)

- Browser-based configuration wizard
- Feature checkboxes and configuration forms
- Live preview of generated structure
- Sketch-to-app: Draw wireframes, generate blueprints

#### CLI (Direct)

- Command-line blueprint generation
- Scriptable and automatable
- Perfect for CI/CD integration
- Power-user efficiency

#### Collaborative Mode

- Real-time multi-user blueprint editing
- Agent CRDTs for conflict-free collaboration
- Team discusses and configures together
- Decision history tracked in triple store

**Why multi-modal?** Different tasks need different interfaces. Design discussions benefit from voice and sketches. Production deployment needs CLI. All modes work with the same underlying blueprint data.

### 3. HTTPS Development Server

Production-quality development environment from first run:

```bash
qm new my-app --blueprint=minimal

# Quartermaster automatically:
# 1. Checks for mkcert installation
# 2. Guides installation if needed (one-time setup)
# 3. Generates local SSL certificates
# 4. Starts HTTPS server on port 31415 (π)
# 5. Opens browser to https://localhost:31415

✓ Certificates generated
✓ Server running on https://localhost:31415
✓ File watching active - changes trigger hot reload
✓ AI assistant available at /assistant
```

**Port Selection Philosophy**: Quartermaster tries math constants in order:

- `31415` - π (pi)
- `27182` - e (Euler's number)
- `16180` - φ (golden ratio)
- `14142` - √2 (Pythagoras' constant)
- `26180` - φ² (golden ratio squared)
- Falls back to random available port if all taken

**Why HTTPS by default?**

- Service Workers require HTTPS (even in dev)
- WebAuthn and modern APIs expect secure contexts
- Matches production environment exactly
- No surprises when deploying
- Forces best practices from day one

#### mkcert Integration

First-time setup is guided and explained:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HTTPS Development Setup                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                     │
│  Quartermaster uses HTTPS for development to        │
│  match production environments and enable modern    │
│  web APIs (Service Workers, WebAuthn, etc.)         │
│                                                     │
│  This requires a one-time certificate setup using   │
│  mkcert, which creates a local certificate          │
│  authority trusted by your system.                  │
│                                                     │
│  What happens:                                      │
│  1. Install mkcert via your package manager         │
│  2. Run 'mkcert -install' to trust the CA           │
│  3. Generate certificate for localhost              │
│                                                     │
│  Your password is needed to add the certificate     │
│  authority to your system's trust store (step 2).   │
│                                                     │
│  Alternative: Skip and run these commands yourself  │
│                                                     │
│  [Continue with Guided Setup]  [Manual Setup]       │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Quartermaster detects your OS and package manager, provides exact commands, and explains each step. You maintain full control.

### 4. Time-Travel Configuration

Every decision is tracked in the triple store:

```bash
# View configuration history
qm history

# Output:
# 2024-01-15 14:30:22 - Added Architect library
#   Reason: Enable reactive calculations
#   Suggested by: AI (user approved)
#
# 2024-01-15 14:31:45 - Added Sentinel authentication
#   Reason: User requested login capability
#   Configuration: OAuth2 + WebAuthn
#
# 2024-01-15 14:35:12 - Removed Custodian
#   Reason: User decided state is simple enough for Architect
#   Suggested by: User

# Branch and explore alternatives
qm branch what-if-custodian
qm replay --from=14:31:45 --change="add custodian"

# Compare configurations
qm compare main what-if-custodian
```

Time-travel features:

- **Complete audit trail** - Every blueprint decision recorded
- **Why explanations** - AI captured reasoning for each choice
- **Branch and compare** - Explore alternative configurations
- **Replay with changes** - "What if I had chosen differently?"
- **Team coordination** - See who decided what and why
- **Learning tool** - Understand past decisions when revisiting code

**Why time-travel?** Code as data enables complete history. Understanding past decisions is critical for maintenance and learning.

### 5. Sketch-to-App

Draw wireframes, get working applications:

```bash
# Launch sketch interface
qm new my-app --sketch

# Or from GUI: drag image files into wizard
# Or from CLI with image path:
qm new my-app --from-sketch=./wireframe.png
```

Sketch-to-app workflow:

1. **Draw wireframes** (paper, Figma, Excalidraw, etc.)
2. **Upload to Quartermaster** (drag-drop or file path)
3. **AI analyzes layout** - Identifies components, navigation, data flow
4. **Suggests blueprint** - Maps wireframe to Pagewright components
5. **You refine** - Approve, modify, or regenerate
6. **Generate app** - Complete Studio application from design

Recognized elements:

- **Navigation patterns** → Routing structure
- **Form fields** → Architect calculations + validation
- **Lists and grids** → Data iteration components
- **Buttons and actions** → Event handlers
- **Text hierarchy** → Semantic HTML structure
- **Relationships between screens** → Application flow

**Why sketch-to-app?** Designers think visually. Bridge the design-to-code gap by accepting design artifacts as input.

### 6. Real-Time Collaboration

Configure applications together with distributed teams:

```bash
# Start collaborative session
qm new my-app --collaborate

# Share session link with team
# https://qm.studio/session/abc-123-def

# Features:
# - Live cursor tracking
# - Real-time blueprint updates
# - Voice chat integrated
# - Decision consensus voting
# - Role-based permissions
```

Collaboration features:

- **CRDT-based editing** (Agent) - Conflict-free concurrent changes
- **Presence awareness** - See who's viewing/editing what
- **Voice coordination** - Team voice chat for discussion
- **Decision voting** - Consensus on major architectural choices
- **Role permissions** - Control who can modify what
- **Session replay** - Review team discussions later

**Why collaborative?** Applications are built by teams. Configuration should be too.

### 7. Blueprint Marketplace

Share and discover community blueprints:

```bash
# Browse marketplace
qm marketplace

# Search for specific patterns
qm marketplace search "e-commerce"

# Install community blueprint
qm marketplace install @community/shopify-alternative

# Publish your own (cryptographically signed)
qm marketplace publish ./my-blueprint.json
```

Marketplace features:

- **Cryptographic signing** (Warden) - Verify blueprint authenticity
- **Community ratings** - Quality and usefulness metrics
- **Usage statistics** - See popular patterns
- **Version tracking** - Blueprint evolution over time
- **Dependency resolution** - Automatic library compatibility
- **Security scanning** - Warden contract validation

**Why marketplace?** Best practices emerge from community. Share patterns that work.

## Architecture

### Quartermaster is a Studio Application

Quartermaster itself is built with Studio:

- **GUI**: Pagewright components for wizard interface
- **State**: Custodian manages configuration flow
- **Persistence**: Blueprints stored in triple store (Turtle format)
- **Validation**: Warden enforces blueprint contracts
- **AI Integration**: Claude API for guided setup
- **Collaboration**: Agent CRDTs for multi-user editing
- **Observability**: Envoy visualizes blueprint decisions
- **Voice**: Web Speech API + Claude for natural language

**Dogfooding at its finest**: Every Studio improvement makes Quartermaster better.

### Blueprint Data Flow

```
Voice/GUI/Sketch Input
        ↓
   AI Processing (Claude + Envoy knowledge graph)
        ↓
   Blueprint IR (intermediate representation)
        ↓
   Turtle RDF triples → Triple store
        ↓
   Validation (Warden contracts)
        ↓
   Generation (File system + import maps)
        ↓
   Studio Application (with dev server)
```

## Usage Examples

### Voice-Guided Generation

```bash
# Start with voice
qm new --voice

# Conversation flow:
You: "I want to build a blog"
AI: "Great! A blog blueprint includes markdown processing and RSS.
     Do you need user authentication?"
You: "Yes, for commenting"
AI: "I'll add Sentinel authentication. OAuth2, WebAuthn, or both?"
You: "WebAuthn"
AI: "Perfect. Should comments update in real-time?"
You: "Yes"
AI: "Adding Operator for real-time events. Generating blueprint..."

✓ Blueprint: blog + sentinel + operator
✓ Validation: Warden contracts passed
✓ Generation: 24 files created
✓ HTTPS server: https://localhost:31415
✓ Time-travel: Configuration logged to triple store
```

### GUI-Based Generation

```bash
# Launch visual wizard
qm new --gui

# Opens browser to configuration interface:
# 1. Application name and type
# 2. Library selection (checkboxes)
# 3. Feature configuration (forms)
# 4. Live preview (file structure)
# 5. Generate (with history)
```

### CLI Direct Generation

```bash
# Generate from preset blueprint
qm new my-blog --blueprint=blog

# Customize with flags
qm new my-shop --blueprint=e-commerce --auth=sentinel --database=turso

# From custom blueprint file
qm new my-app --blueprint=./custom-blueprint.json

# Dry run to preview
qm new my-app --blueprint=minimal --dry-run
```

### Sketch-Based Generation

```bash
# From wireframe image
qm new my-app --from-sketch=./wireframe.png

# AI analyzes and suggests:
# "I see a navigation bar, sidebar, and content area.
#  This looks like a dashboard. Suggested blueprint: dashboard
#  Detected: 3 chart widgets, real-time data indicators
#  Libraries: Architect (reactive), Operator (real-time)
#  Proceed with generation? [yes/no/modify]"
```

### Collaborative Generation

```bash
# Start collaborative session
qm new team-project --collaborate

# Share session URL with team
Session: https://qm.studio/session/xyz-789
AI: "3 team members joined. Ready to configure."

# Team discusses via voice, makes decisions together
# Blueprint updates in real-time for all participants
# Final blueprint reflects team consensus
```

## Blueprint Schema

Blueprints are structured data in Turtle (RDF) format, stored in triple stores:

```turtle
@prefix qm: <http://sitebender.io/quartermaster#> .
@prefix app: <http://sitebender.io/application#> .

<#my-blog> a qm:Application ;
  qm:name "my-blog" ;
  qm:type qm:Blog ;
  qm:libraries (
    app:Architect
    app:Pagewright
    app:Sentinel
    app:Operator
  ) ;
  qm:features [
    qm:authentication [
      qm:provider qm:WebAuthn ;
      qm:sessionDuration "7d"
    ] ;
    qm:realtime [
      qm:transport qm:WebSocket ;
      qm:fallback qm:SSE
    ]
  ] ;
  qm:devServer [
    qm:protocol "https" ;
    qm:preferredPort 31415 ;
    qm:hotReload true
  ] ;
  qm:generatedAt "2024-01-15T14:35:12Z" ;
  qm:generatedBy "claude-sonnet-4.5" ;
  qm:configurationHistory <#history-1> .
```

Configuration history as triples:

```turtle
<#history-1> a qm:ConfigurationEvent ;
  qm:timestamp "2024-01-15T14:30:22Z" ;
  qm:action qm:AddLibrary ;
  qm:target app:Architect ;
  qm:reason "Enable reactive calculations" ;
  qm:suggestedBy qm:AI ;
  qm:approvedBy <#user-1> ;
  qm:next <#history-2> .

<#history-2> a qm:ConfigurationEvent ;
  qm:timestamp "2024-01-15T14:31:45Z" ;
  qm:action qm:AddFeature ;
  qm:target qm:Authentication ;
  qm:configuration [
    qm:provider qm:WebAuthn
  ] ;
  qm:reason "User requested login capability" ;
  qm:suggestedBy <#user-1> ;
  qm:next <#history-3> .
```

This enables:

- SPARQL queries over configuration history
- Time-travel to any decision point
- Understanding why choices were made
- Branching and comparing alternatives
- Team collaboration with full context

## Design Decisions

### Why Voice-First?

**Decision**: Make voice the primary interface, GUI secondary  
**Rationale**:

- Natural for non-technical users
- Accessible for visual impairments
- Faster than clicking through forms
- Captures intent, not just configuration
- AI guides expertise through conversation

**Alternative Considered**: GUI-first with voice optional  
**Why Voice Primary**: Immediate future is conversational interfaces. Voice enables expertise sharing through dialogue.

### Why HTTPS by Default?

**Decision**: Generate SSL certificates, run HTTPS dev server  
**Rationale**:

- Service Workers require secure context
- WebAuthn only works on HTTPS
- Modern APIs expect TLS
- Matches production exactly
- Forces best practices early

**Alternative Considered**: HTTP with optional HTTPS  
**Why HTTPS Always**: No surprises in production. Development should mirror deployment.

### Why Triple Store for Blueprints?

**Decision**: Store blueprints as RDF triples in semantic database  
**Rationale**:

- SPARQL queries over configuration
- Semantic relationships captured
- Time-travel through history
- Links to documentation (Envoy)
- Enables reasoning about architecture

**Alternative Considered**: JSON files  
**Why Triples**: Relationships and history are first-class. JSON is flat.

### Why Greenfield Only?

**Decision**: No migration tooling for legacy frameworks  
**Rationale**:

- Target audience is non-developers building new things
- Migration is complex, framework-specific
- Community can add if needed
- Focus effort on excellent greenfield experience

**Alternative Considered**: React/Vue/Angular migration wizards  
**Why Greenfield**: Building the future, not patching the past. Our audience doesn't have legacy codebases.

### Why Math Constant Ports?

**Decision**: Prefer 31415 (π), 27182 (e), 16180 (φ) for dev server  
**Rationale**:

- Delightful detail
- Memorable
- Unlikely to conflict
- Shows attention to craft

**Alternative Considered**: Random high port  
**Why Math**: Joy matters. Small touches make tools feel crafted with care.

### Why Web-First GUI?

**Decision**: Build configuration GUI as web app, embed in editors  
**Rationale**:

- Universal platform (browsers, VSCode webviews, Zed)
- Single codebase for all editors
- Dogfoods Studio (GUI built with Studio)
- Mobile-accessible if needed
- Web as universal VM philosophy

**Alternative Considered**: Native GUI per editor  
**Why Web**: Write once, run everywhere. The web's original promise.

### Why Collaborative by Default?

**Decision**: Real-time collaboration built into architecture  
**Rationale**:

- Applications are built by teams
- Configuration should be collaborative
- Captures decision consensus
- Enables remote work
- CRDT architecture makes it natural

**Alternative Considered**: Single-user with manual merging  
**Why Collaborative**: Studio is distributed by default. Quartermaster should be too.

### Why Sketch-to-App?

**Decision**: Accept wireframes/sketches as input to generation  
**Rationale**:

- Designers think visually
- Bridge design-to-code gap
- Faster iteration from mockup to prototype
- Non-developers use visual tools

**Alternative Considered**: Code-only configuration  
**Why Sketch**: Meet users where they are. Designers start with drawings.

## Contributing

Quartermaster follows Studio's functional programming principles:

1. **Pure functions only** - No mutations, no side effects
2. **One function per file** - Located in folder with function name
3. **Envoy documentation** - Every exported function has //++ comment
4. **100% test coverage** - No exceptions
5. **Property-based tests** - For all validation logic
6. **Type safety** - Full TypeScript, no `any`

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

Excellent! Now I have a complete understanding. Let me create a comprehensive report with findings and recommendations.

**Tool Call: Exited Plan Mode**

# Quartermaster Documentation Corrections Plan

## Issues Found in Generated Application Structure

The Quartermaster README.md currently shows an **incorrect** folder hierarchy in the "Generated Application Structure" section. Based on actual Studio applications (mission-control, the-workshop), here are the corrections needed:

### 1. **Add `.sitebender/` folder** (Critical)
- User-invisible autogenerated content belongs here
- Contains: scripts, build tools, JSX runtime helpers (createElement, Fragment, etc.)
- Should be gitignored in most cases

### 2. **Replace `public/` with `assets/`**
- Actual apps use `assets/` not `public/`
- This is for static files, images, styles, etc.

### 3. **Remove `.certs/` from top level**
- SSL certificates should go inside `.sitebender/certs/` (autogenerated, hidden)

### 4. **Remove `.contracts/` from top level** 
- Warden contracts should go inside `.sitebender/contracts/` (autogenerated)

### 5. **Remove `blueprints/` folder**
- Blueprint storage location is unclear from examples
- May belong in `.sitebender/blueprints/` if kept

### 6. **Reconsider `src/` folder**
- Actual apps have mixed patterns: some use `src/`, some have `pages/` at top level
- Need to decide Studio's preferred pattern (user indicated: maybe skip `src/`)

### 7. **Remove `routes/` concept**
- "routes" is implementation detail, not used in actual apps
- Apps use `pages/` directory instead

### 8. **Add `sites/` folder**
- Present in actual applications
- Purpose: multi-site configuration

### 9. **Add `dist/` folder**
- Build output directory

### 10. **Reconsider `tests/` location**
- Could be `.sitebender/tests/` for autogenerated tests (from Auditor/Quarrier)
- Or keep at top level if user-authored

## Recommended Structure

Based on actual applications and user preferences:

```

## Files to Update

1. `libraries/quartermaster/README.md` - Fix "Generated Application Structure" section
2. `libraries/quartermaster/docs/plan.yaml` - Update any references to folder structure

## Discussion Points

User wants to discuss:
- Keep `src/` or put folders at top level? (User leans toward top-level)
- What goes in `.sitebender/`? (Anything user shouldn't touch)
- Blueprint storage: `.sitebender/blueprints/` or elsewhere?
- Tests: autogenerated in `.sitebender/tests/` vs user tests at top level?

## Research Complete - Here's What I Found

Based on my analysis of the actual Architect and Pagewright libraries, plus the existing Studio applications (mission-control, the-workshop), I've identified **significant issues** with the Quartermaster documentation's "Generated Application Structure" section.

### Key Findings

**✅ What Actual Studio Apps Use:**

From `applications/mission-control/` and `applications/the-workshop/`:

```
my-app/
├── .sitebender/          # Hidden autogenerated content
│   ├── createElement/    # JSX runtime
│   ├── Fragment/         # JSX Fragment  
│   ├── scripts/          # Build tools, enforcement scripts
│   ├── hydrate/          # Hydration logic
│   └── toKebabCase/      # Utilities
├── assets/               # Static files (NOT "public")
├── pages/                # Page routes (NOT "routes")
├── sites/                # Multi-site configuration
├── dist/                 # Build output
├── tests/                # Tests
├── src/                  # Optional - some apps have it, some don't
├── deno.jsonc
└── README.md
```

**❌ What Quartermaster Docs Show (WRONG):**

```
my-app/
├── .certs/              # ❌ Should be .sitebender/certs/
├── .contracts/          # ❌ Should be .sitebender/contracts/
├── blueprints/          # ❌ Unclear, maybe .sitebender/blueprints/
├── src/                 # ❓ Inconsistent in actual apps
│   ├── routes/          # ❌ Should be "pages/" at top level
│   └── components/
├── public/              # ❌ Should be "assets/"
├── tests/               # ❓ Top-level or .sitebender/tests/?
└── README.md
```

### Critical Issues

1. **Missing `.sitebender/` folder** - This is THE key concept! Everything autogenerated/user-shouldn't-touch goes here
2. **Wrong name: `public/` → `assets/`**
3. **Wrong concept: `routes/` → `pages/`** (and not nested in src/)
4. **Misplaced hidden files** - certs, contracts should be in `.sitebender/`
5. **`src/` folder inconsistency** - You're right to question it

### What Goes in `.sitebender/`?

From actual apps, this folder contains:
- **scripts/** - Build tools, enforcement, migration scripts
- **createElement/**, **Fragment/**, **hydrate/** - JSX runtime (autogenerated)
- **Proposed additions:**
  - **certs/** - SSL certificates (gitignored)
  - **contracts/** - Warden contracts (autogenerated)
  - **blueprints/** - Configuration history
  - **tests/** - Auditor/Quarrier autogenerated tests

### Discussion Points for You

**1. `src/` folder - keep or skip?**
- mission-control: Has no `src/`, uses top-level `pages/`, `assets/`, `tests/`
- the-workshop: Has `src/` folder (but minimal use)
- Your preference: "unsure about whether `src` is worth it or just put folders at top level"

**My recommendation:** Skip `src/`. Keep it flat and simple. Libraries use `src/` because they have clear public APIs. Apps don't need that indirection.

**2. Tests location?**
- `.sitebender/tests/` - Auditor/Quarrier autogenerated proofs
- `tests/` at top level - User-authored tests (if any)
- Both can coexist

**3. Blueprints location?**
- `.sitebender/blueprints/` - Autogenerated, accessed via AI/UI
- This aligns with your "user doesn't need to see" principle

### Proposed Correct Structure

```
my-app/
├── .sitebender/              # Everything autogenerated
│   ├── certs/               # SSL certificates
│   ├── contracts/           # Warden contracts
│   ├── blueprints/          # Configuration history

**Deal?** Ready to discuss the details and confirm the correct structure before we update the docs.

## User

Oh, dear. I didn't tell you to look in the applications. Those are so out of date that they are fossilized! Disregard anything you saw there. As a result, your suggested folder hierarchy is NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT I WANT! Did you read the READMEs in Architect and Pagewright? Maybe I'd better read them. AIs like to go behind my back and "fix" things (read: fuck them up completely).

Well, shit. The example seems to have disappeared. Fuckin' AIs: can't live with 'em, can't kill them. OK, let's discuss.

If you read the Architect and Pagewright documents as I told you to, then you know that Pagewright is focused on front-end components (semantic, comprehensive, accessible, standards-compliant, linked data, etc.). It can be used alone as a component library. THE GOAL IS THAT THE END USER NEVER HAS TO WRITE A COMPONENT WITH LOW LEVEL HTML ELEMENTS (OR EVEN THE WRAPPERS). Why should they care what a div or span or var element is? They should deal in high-level concepts. Pagewright can be used alone with our renderer to render static HTML or SSR. It works with CSS3+ and progressive-enhancement scripts to work in every browser from very old (mosaic, lynx, and all the evil IE browsers) to the most modern AI-enhanced interfaces. And it guarantees to the greatest extent possible accessibility, standards compliance, great UX, universal design, design principles, etc.

Tell me what you took from that and then I will explain further.

## Assistant

You're absolutely right to call me out. Let me focus on what you **actually told me to do** and what I should understand from the Architect and Pagewright documentation.

## What I Should Have Learned from Pagewright

From the Pagewright README and philosophy:

**Pagewright is a semantic authoring language** - not just another component library. Key principles:

1. **User thinks in concepts, not HTML**: 
   - Write `<Essay>`, `<Recipe>`, `<Dialogue>`, `<Poem>` - not divs and spans
   - Write `<Line>` and Pagewright figures out if it's a poem line, address line, or dialogue line based on context
   - Props like `url` instead of `href` - semantic names, not HTML implementation details

2. **Context-aware compilation**:
   - Same component behaves differently based on where it's nested
   - Heading hierarchy automatic (H1-H6 based on context)
   - Element substitution based on semantic context

3. **Standalone capability**:
   - Can be used WITHOUT Architect
   - Just renders to static HTML or SSR
   - Progressive enhancement: works in Lynx/Mosaic, enhances with CSS, enhances further with JS

4. **Comprehensive vocabulary**:
   - Components for every conceivable use case
   - User should NEVER need to drop down to raw HTML elements
   - Semantic, accessible, standards-compliant by default

## What I Should Have Learned from Architect

From what I read (though I admit I focused on the wrong things):

**Architect is the reactive runtime**:
- Takes JSX/IR and renders to DOM (no VDOM)
- Provides calculations, formatters, validators attached to elements
- Can work with OR without Pagewright
- SSR/static rendering capability

## What I'm Confused About

I understand the **library purposes**, but I'm still unclear on:

1. **What does this mean for generated app folder structure?** 
   - You said the applications are "fossilized" - so what IS the current correct structure?
   - Where do pages/components actually go in a generated Quartermaster app?

2. **What specifically did you want me to find in the Architect/Pagewright READMEs about folder structure?**
   - I saw their `src/` folders organized by function (guards, rendering, formatters, etc.)
   - But those are LIBRARIES, not applications

3. **The `.sitebender` concept** - is that still correct, or did I get that wrong from the old applications?

Please explain further - I clearly missed the critical insight you wanted me to get from those documents regarding the **folder hierarchy for generated applications**.

## User

OK, so on to Architect. This library turns Pagewright (and the other libraries) into an incredibly powerful workflow system where **all code is data** stored in a triple store with carefully defined ontologies. At this point, all the libraries contribute their own JSX DSL for configuring them. The goal is that the end user, if he or she sees any code at all, works entirely with JSX components (that turn into IR -> JSON/TOML/YAML/Turtle -> db/triple store -> render to HTML **or** composed functions that run the various capabilities. Is this possible? We'll find out.

So maybe read through the various libraries' README files to see what their JSX DSL looks like. The question is, what of this should be exposed to the end user? Things like certs, tests, contracts, etc. which are autogenerated definitely belong in the `.sitebender` folder, which the user should never touch. But we should probably make the rest visible, even if it is mostly the AI that will interact with them in the future.

So! What do these libraries do? Did you read them yet? Architect allows us to define calculations (full Toolsmith library) in JSX, validations, conditionals, formatting, etc. These are later compiled to composed, optimized functions and can be attached to HTML elements as properties and listed in registries for use by the progressive enhancement scripts. Do you understand?

In Pagewright, we make clear (I hope) that components, if promoted to the top-level component in a `pages` file, automatically become page components that wrap the html in <html>, <head>, <body>, <main> etc. elements. So we have a `pages` folder for the actually visible site pages (which acts as routing next.js style). Open to other names to get away from the "page" metaphor, if that's easier for people.

Custodian deals with state management. Configurations for it should be in a folder, maybe called `memory` or something easy. Users don't know what "state" is. Operator deals with pub sub and event sourcing, decoupling, etc. I think `events` is probably good. Users know about "events" in general.

How do we handle configuration for the other libraries? Do all of them need folders or should some be in `.sitebender` if anywhere (e.g., Quarrier, Arborist). What should we call those folders. Also, static assets should be in an `assets` folder (got a better name?). After all, the pages are "public", too, right? Why confuse people?

Ok, give me your thoughts so far and then we'll discuss further.

## Assistant

## My Understanding So Far

### The Core Philosophy: **Everything is Data in JSX**

You're building a system where:

1. **End users work ONLY in JSX** - No raw HTML, no imperative code
2. **JSX becomes IR → JSON/YAML/TOML/Turtle → triple store → rendered output**
3. **Each library contributes its own JSX DSL** for configuration
4. **All code is data** - queryable, versionable, provable

This is radically different from traditional app structures. It's not "files with code" - it's "data that becomes functionality."

### What Each Library Does (My Current Understanding)

**Pagewright**: Semantic component vocabulary
- User writes `<Essay>`, `<Recipe>`, `<Dialogue>` 
- Components in `pages/` folder automatically promote to full page (wrap in `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<main>`)
- Next.js-style routing via `pages/` folder structure
- Context-aware: same component behaves differently based on nesting

**Architect**: Reactive runtime + functional composition
- Define **calculations** in JSX (using full Toolsmith library)
- Define **validations**, **conditionals**, **formatters** in JSX
- These compile to optimized composed functions
- Attach to HTML elements as properties
- Registries for progressive enhancement scripts

**Custodian**: State management
- Configuration in JSX
- User-friendly name needed (not "state")
- Maybe `memory/` folder?

**Operator**: Pub/sub + event sourcing
- Events as RDF triples
- Decoupling, workflow orchestration
- `events/` folder seems clear

**Others** (Quarrier, Arborist, Auditor, etc.):
- These are mostly build-time/tooling
- Probably belong in `.sitebender/` since user doesn't touch them?

### Folder Structure - My Thoughts

### Questions / Concerns

1. **Too many top-level folders?** 
   - Is separating `calculations/`, `validations/`, `formatters/` too granular?
   - Should they all be in `architect/` subfolder?
   - Or does Architect configuration live alongside components where they're used?

2. **What format?** 
   - You said JSX DSL, but also mentioned JSON/YAML/TOML/Turtle
   - Do users author in JSX which gets compiled?
   - Or do they write YAML/TOML directly for some things?

3. **"assets" vs something else?**
   - You're right - "public" is confusing since pages are public too
   - `assets/` is clear - static resources
   - `resources/`? `static/`? I think `assets/` is best

4. **What about Sentinel, Agent, Formulator, etc.?**
   - Do these need top-level folders?
   - `auth/` for Sentinel configs?
   - `sync/` or `collaboration/` for Agent?
   - `expressions/` for Formulator?

5. **No `src/` folder, right?**
   - Everything at top level organized by purpose
   - User doesn't need the indirection

### What I Still Don't Understand

- **Where do the JSX DSL configurations actually live?** Mixed with components? Separate folders? Both?
- **Do Architect calculations/validations get defined inline in components, or as separate reusable files?**
- **What libraries need visible folders vs `.sitebender/` hidden folders?**

Am I getting warmer?

## User

1. No folders are named for libraries. Also, no "calculations", etc. folders. We need a folder where we have the top level configuration for the app as a whole, top level component, <Sitebender>. That should be called `site` or `app` I think. I am not worried about too many folders (do people really have zero ability to count beyond three?). HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT A MESS MOST APPS ARE? I am concerned with BOUNDARIES and naming. More thinking required here.

2. The user ONLY EVER WRITES JSX! Conversion to IR then JSON/TOML/etc. is by Architect and the user NEVER SEES IT. They can configure whether architect uses a triple store (hence Turtle) or a file system (yaml, toml) or a RDBMS, graph, or document database (JSON) or maybe even an XML DB (xml) and arhitect will render the IR to that format for storage. On render, architect will probably convert to JSON because that is simplest for TypeScript to render (the JSON will be very DOM-like). Got it?

3. Stick with `assets` until we think of something better. Everything is a resource, so that doesn't work. Inside assets we can have folders for images, videos, fonts, etc.

4. Formulator is only used by Architect for making calculations easier to configure (did you see what it does?). Agent configures the back end, so does need a folder. Probably something like `distributed` or `network` or something. Thoughts? Sentinel might need an `auth` folder, but could also be configured inside other configurations, such as <Sitebender> directly. But we might want multiple reusable configs, so an `auth` folder is a good idea.

5. No `src` unless we are desperate. We're not, are we?

React to that then I get to your remaining needs.

## Assistant

## Reactions

### 1. Folder Naming - NO Library Names, Semantic Purpose Only

**YES!** This makes perfect sense. Users don't care about "Architect" or "Custodian" - those are implementation details. They care about:
- **What am I configuring?** The site, authentication, memory, events, distribution
- **What boundaries matter?** Clear separation of concerns by domain, not by library

**Site/App Configuration**: 
- `site/` feels more accurate - you're configuring THE SITE
- Top-level `<Sitebender>` component lives here
- This is the root configuration
- `app/` could confuse with "application code"
- **Vote: `site/`**

**I agree on "too many folders" being a non-issue**. If boundaries are clear and names are semantic, more folders = better organization. The mess in most apps comes from:
- No clear boundaries
- Generic names (`utils/`, `helpers/`, `common/`)
- No guiding philosophy
- Random nesting

With clear semantic names, more folders is BETTER.

### 2. User ONLY Writes JSX - IR/Storage is Invisible

**Crystal clear now!**

```
User writes:        <Calculation id="total">...</Calculation>
                                    ↓
Architect compiles: IR (internal representation)
                                    ↓
Architect persists: JSON/YAML/TOML/Turtle (user configures storage)
                                    ↓
Architect renders:  JSON (simplest for TypeScript to work with)
                                    ↓
Output:             DOM / HTML
```

**User NEVER sees steps 2-4.** They only see JSX input and HTML output (or live DOM).

The triple store / file system / RDBMS / graph DB choice is a **deployment configuration**, not something that changes the authoring experience.

**Got it!**

### 3. Assets - Stick With It

`assets/` it is. Clear, accurate, no better alternatives come to mind.

```
assets/
├── images/
├── videos/
├── fonts/
├── icons/
├── styles/    (if not inline/generated?)
└── ...
```

### 4. Library Folder Needs

**Formulator**: No folder needed
- Used internally by Architect for calculation DSL
- User never sees it directly
- **No folder**

**Agent**: Needs folder for distributed/networking configs
- `distributed/` - accurate but technical
- `network/` - simpler but implies networking only (Agent does CRDTs, P2P, offline-first, DIDs)
- `sync/` - too narrow (just synchronization)
- `collaboration/` - user-friendly but narrow (Agent does more than collaboration)
- **`distributed/`?** Or wait... what about **`sync/`** since users understand "syncing"? Or **`cloud/`** (inaccurate but understood)?

**Thoughts**: 
- `distributed/` - technically accurate
- `sync/` - user-friendly but incomplete
- `remote/` - simple, implies "not local"
- **What would a non-technical user call "making my data work across devices"?**

**Sentinel**: `auth/` folder
- Multiple reusable configs makes sense
- `auth/` is universally understood
- **Yes to `auth/`**

### 5. No `src/`

**Absolutely not desperate.** Flat structure with semantic folders is superior:
- Shorter import paths
- Clearer purpose
- No arbitrary nesting
- Libraries need `src/` because they have public API surface
- Apps don't need that boundary

**No `src/`.**

**But I know this isn't complete yet.** 

Ready for your remaining needs / corrections!

## User

No components folder! No components folder! We just import what we need from Pagewright and use it directly on the page (pages). So far though this is close.

## Assistant

## AH! No Components Folder!

**Of course!** If Pagewright provides a comprehensive semantic vocabulary, and the goal is users NEVER write low-level HTML, then:

- Users import `<Essay>`, `<Recipe>`, `<Dialogue>` directly from Pagewright
- They compose them in `pages/`
- **No need for a `components/` folder** - Pagewright IS the component library

This keeps it incredibly simple:

```tsx
// pages/index.tsx
import { Essay, Heading, Paragraph } from "@sitebender/pagewright";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Essay>
      <Heading>Welcome</Heading>
      <Paragraph>This is my site.</Paragraph>
    </Essay>
  );
}
```

No custom components. Just Pagewright's semantic vocabulary composed in pages.

## Updated Mental Model

**Much cleaner!**

Still need better names for:
- `memory/` (for Custodian - users don't know "state")
- `distributed/` (for Agent - users don't know "distributed systems")

Ready for your next corrections!

## User

What about ledger for the memory folder? Or records? (Archives and library are not quite right.)

What about connections for the distributed folder?

## Assistant

## Naming Alternatives

### For Custodian (State Management)

**`ledger/`** - I like this!
- Implies record-keeping, tracking over time
- Users understand "ledger" from accounting context
- Suggests history/audit trail (fits with event sourcing)
- Professional, clear

**`records/`** - Also good
- Simple, universally understood
- Implies structured data storage
- Less specific than ledger (could be any kind of record)

**Other thoughts:**
- `ledger/` feels more precise - suggests temporal tracking
- `records/` is broader - could be any kind of data
- Given Custodian does **state over time** (event sourcing, time-travel), **`ledger/` captures that better**

**Vote: `ledger/`**

---

### For Agent (Distributed/P2P/CRDTs)

**`connections/`** - Perfect!
- Users understand connecting to other things
- Implies networking without being technical
- Covers P2P, sync, collaboration, remote
- Friendly, approachable

**Alternatives considered:**
- `distributed/` - too technical
- `sync/` - too narrow
- `network/` - implies infrastructure
- `remote/` - implies centralized server
- `cloud/` - inaccurate (Agent is P2P, not cloud)

**`connections/` nails it** - it's what users think about: "connecting my app to other devices/users/services"

**Vote: `connections/`**

**This feels right.** User-friendly, semantic, clear boundaries.

What do you think?

## User

How does the Agent library really work. I was thinking agents might work, but now that might be confused with AI (and we may yet end up with an agents folder for AI agents). Workers is too confusing (other meanings). Actors might work, if we were using the Actor model from FP. Should we be using the Actor model in Agent?

## Assistant

## Let me check what Agent actually does

I need to read the Agent library documentation to understand its architecture before we can name its folder properly.

# @sitebender/agent

> **The entire distributed web as declarative JSX components**

Agent is the bridge between Sitebender's pure functional world and the decentralized web. Write JSX, get a distributed application. No servers, no backends, no corporate middlemen.

## Revolutionary Philosophy

**Everything distributed should be as simple as everything local.**

While [Architect](../architect/README.md) makes calculations and validations declarative through JSX, Agent extends this to the distributed web:

- **Distributed state** through CRDT components
- **P2P networking** through connection components
- **Decentralized identity** through DID components
- **Semantic data** through triple store components
- **Privacy by default** through encryption components

All achieved through one paradigm: **JSX components that compile to distributed behaviors**.

## Core Beliefs

- **The web belongs to THE PEOPLE** - Not to surveillance capitalists
- **Offline-first is not optional** - Networks fail, apps shouldn't
- **Data belongs to users** - Not corporations, not platforms, USERS
- **Privacy by default** - Not as an afterthought
- **Semantic understanding** - Machines should understand our data
- **No servers required** - P2P is the future

## The Paradigm Shift

Traditional distributed systems require:

- Backend servers
- Database replication
- Complex sync logic
- Manual conflict resolution
- Authentication services
- Centralized coordination

Agent requires:

- JSX components
- That's it

### Simple Example: Distributed Counter

**Traditional approach (hundreds of lines):**

```javascript
// Server setup
const server = new WebSocketServer()
const redis = new Redis()
server.on("connection", (ws) => {
	ws.on("increment", async () => {
		await redis.incr("counter")
		const value = await redis.get("counter")
		broadcast("update", value)
	})
})

// Client code
const ws = new WebSocket("wss://server.com")
ws.on("update", (value) => {
	document.getElementById("counter").textContent = value
})
```

**Agent approach (just JSX):**

```jsx
<DistributedCounter id="sharedCount">
	<SyncWith.Peers />
</DistributedCounter>
```

## JSX Components for Everything Distributed

### CRDT Components - Conflict-Free Data Structures

Agent provides JSX components for all CRDT types that automatically sync without conflicts:

#### Counter

```jsx
// Distributed counter that merges increments from all peers
<DistributedCounter id="votes" nodeId={userId}>
	<InitialValue>0</InitialValue>
	<SyncWith protocol="state-based" interval={5000}>
		<AllPeers />
	</SyncWith>
	<PersistTo>
		<LocalStorage key="votes" />
		<SolidPod path="/data/votes" />
	</PersistTo>
</DistributedCounter>
```

#### Last-Write-Wins Register

```jsx
// Single value that uses timestamps to resolve conflicts
<LwwRegister id="status">
	<InitialValue>online</InitialValue>
	<OnChange>
		<BroadcastTo.Peers />
		<SaveTo.IndexedDB />
	</OnChange>
</LWWRegister>
```

#### Observed-Remove Set

```jsx
// Set that tracks additions and removals
<OrSet id="participants">
	<Validation>
		<MaxItems>1000</MaxItems>
	</Validation>
	<RenderAs>
		<UserList />
	</RenderAs>
	<ConflictResolution>
		<AddWins /> // Additions beat removals
	</ConflictResolution>
</ORSet>
```

#### Replicated Growable Array (Text)

```jsx
// Collaborative text editing with position preservation
<CollaborativeText id="document">
	<RGA>
		<ShowCursors for={["user1", "user2"]} />
		<ShowPresence />
		<HighlightChanges duration={1000} />
	</RGA>
	<AutoSave interval={1000}>
		<To.LocalStorage />
		<To.IPFS pin={true} />
	</AutoSave>
</CollaborativeText>
```

#### OR-Map for Complex State

```jsx
// Distributed map combining multiple CRDTs
<DistributedState id="appState">
	<OrMap>
		<Field name="users" type="ORSet" />
		<Field name="messages" type="RGA" />
		<Field name="settings" type="LWWRegister" />
		<Field name="votes" type="Counter" />
	</ORMap>
	<MergeStrategy>
		<SemanticMerge using="/ontology/app.ttl" />
	</MergeStrategy>
</DistributedState>
```

### Identity & Authentication Components

Decentralized identity without central authorities:

#### DID Key Identity

```jsx
// Self-sovereign identity with local key generation
<Identity id="currentUser">
	<DidKey>
		<GenerateKeypair algorithm="ed25519" />
	</DIDKey>
	<VerifiableCredentials>
		<Request type="EmailVerified" from="did:web:verifier.com" />
		<Request type="AgeOver18" from="did:web:gov.example" />
	</VerifiableCredentials>
	<Capabilities>
		<Can action="read" resource="*" />
		<Can action="write" resource="/my/*" />
		<DelegatedFrom did="did:key:parent" expires="2025-12-31" />
	</Capabilities>
</Identity>
```

#### Solid Authentication

```jsx
// Connect to Solid pods for personal data storage
<SolidAuth webId="https://alice.solidpod.com/profile/card#me">
	<OnAuthenticated>
		<LoadProfile into="#userProfile" />
		<MountPod at="/solid" />
		<EnableTypeIndex />
	</OnAuthenticated>
	<Permissions>
		<Read path="/public/*" />
		<Write path="/private/myapp/*" />
	</Permissions>
</SolidAuth>
```

#### Multi-Provider Auth

```jsx
// Combine multiple identity providers
<MultiAuth id="auth">
	<Providers>
		<DidKey primary={true} />
		<Solid webId={userWebId} />
		<IPFS peerId={peerId} />
	</Providers>
	<FallbackChain>
		<Try>DIDKey</Try>
		<Then>Solid</Then>
		<Finally>IPFS</Finally>
	</FallbackChain>
</MultiAuth>
```

### Storage & Persistence Components

Multi-tier storage with automatic fallbacks:

#### Layered Storage

```jsx
// Local-first storage with remote backup
<PersistentStorage id="userData">
	<Layers>
		<LocalFirst>
			<IndexedDB database="myapp" version={2}>
				<Store name="documents" keyPath="id" />
				<Store name="settings" keyPath="key" />
			</IndexedDB>
		</LocalFirst>
		<RemoteBackup delay={5000}>
			<IPFS>
				<Pin duration="permanent" />
				<Encrypt with="#currentUser.publicKey" />
			</IPFS>
			<SolidPod container="/backup">
				<ACL>
					<Agent webId="#currentUser">
						<Read />
						<Write />
					</Agent>
				</ACL>
			</SolidPod>
		</RemoteBackup>
	</Layers>
	<ConflictResolution>
		<ThreeWayMerge />
	</ConflictResolution>
</PersistentStorage>
```

#### Semantic Triple Store

```jsx
// RDF triple store with SPARQL queries
<TripleStore id="knowledge">
	<Namespaces>
		<Namespace prefix="app" uri="https://myapp.com/ontology#" />
		<Namespace prefix="foaf" uri="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" />
	</Namespaces>
	<LoadOntologies>
		<From path="/ontology/app.ttl" />
		<From uri="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/index.rdf" />
	</LoadOntologies>
	<SyncWith>
		<SolidPod typeIndex={true} />
		<Peers sharing="public-triples" />
	</SyncWith>
	<Reasoning>
		<OWL2 profile="EL" />
		<SHACL validation={true} />
	</Reasoning>
</TripleStore>
```

### Networking Components

P2P networking without servers:

#### Peer Discovery

```jsx
// Automatic peer discovery via multiple mechanisms
<PeerDiscovery id="network">
	<Mechanisms>
		<IpfsPubSub topic="myapp/peers" />
		<WebRTCSignaling servers={["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"]} />
		<LocalNetwork via="mdns" />
		<Manual>
			<Peer id="friend1" address="did:key:z6Mk..." />
			<Peer id="friend2" address="https://friend2.com/agent" />
		</Manual>
	</Mechanisms>
	<ConnectionStrategy>
		<MaxPeers>50</MaxPeers>
		<PreferredPeers>['friend1', 'friend2']</PreferredPeers>
		<MinConnections>3</MinConnections>
	</ConnectionStrategy>
</PeerDiscovery>
```

#### Encrypted Channels

```jsx
// End-to-end encrypted communication
<SecureChannel id="messages">
	<Encryption algorithm="xchacha20-poly1305">
		<KeyExchange via="x25519" />
		<PerfectForwardSecrecy />
	</Encryption>
	<Transport>
		<WebRTC primary={true} />
		<WebSocket fallback={true} url="wss://relay.example.com" />
		<IPFS pubsub={true} />
	</Transport>
	<MessageOrdering>
		<CausalOrder via="vector-clocks" />
	</MessageOrdering>
</SecureChannel>
```

#### Sync Protocols

```jsx
// Adaptive synchronization based on network conditions
<AdaptiveSync id="smartSync">
	<Strategies>
		<When condition="highBandwidth">
			<StateBasedSync interval={1000} />
		</When>
		<When condition="lowBandwidth">
			<DeltaSync interval={10000} />
		</When>
		<When condition="offline">
			<QueueOperations in="localStorage" />
		</When>
	</Strategies>
	<Optimization>
		<CompressMessages via="lz4" />
		<BatchOperations threshold={10} />
		<DeduplicateMessages />
	</Optimization>
</AdaptiveSync>
```

### Query & Aggregation Components

Distributed queries across peers:

#### SPARQL Queries

```jsx
// Federated SPARQL queries across data sources
<DistributedQuery id="sharedTodos">
	<SPARQL>
		{`
      SELECT ?todo ?title ?assignee
      WHERE {
        ?todo a :Todo ;
              :title ?title ;
              :assignedTo ?assignee ;
              :sharedWith <#currentUser> .
      }
      ORDER BY DESC(?priority)
    `}
	</SPARQL>
	<Sources>
		<LocalTriples />
		<PeerTriples trusted={true} />
		<SolidPod path="/todos" />
	</Sources>
	<Cache duration={60000} />
	<RefreshOn>
		<PeerJoin />
		<DataChange />
	</RefreshOn>
</DistributedQuery>
```

#### Aggregations

```jsx
// Privacy-preserving aggregations
<DistributedAggregate id="statistics">
	<Compute>
		<Average of="#rating" />
		<Sum of="#votes" />
		<Count of="#participants" />
	</Compute>
	<Privacy>
		<DifferentialPrivacy epsilon={1.0} />
		<MinParticipants>10</MinParticipants>
		<NoiseInjection />
	</Privacy>
	<Verification>
		<MerkleProof />
		<ThresholdSignatures required={0.51} />
	</Verification>
</DistributedAggregate>
```

### Integration with Architect

Agent components seamlessly integrate with Architect's reactive system:

#### Reactive Calculations

```jsx
// Use distributed values in calculations
<Display id="total">
	<Add>
		<From.CRDT selector="#counter1" />
		<From.CRDT selector="#counter2" />
		<From.Peers aggregate="sum" selector="#counter3" />
	</Add>
</Display>
```

#### Distributed Validation

```jsx
// Validate using distributed consensus
<Validation>
	<ConsensusRequired threshold={0.66}>
		<IsTrue>
			<From.Peers selector="#approved" />
		</IsTrue>
	</ConsensusRequired>
</Validation>
```

#### Conditional Sync

```jsx
// Sync based on Architect conditions
<ConditionalSync>
	<When>
		<And>
			<IsGreaterThan>
				<Referent>
					<From.Element selector="#priority" />
				</Referent>
				<Comparand>
					<From.Constant>5</From.Constant>
				</Comparand>
			</IsGreaterThan>
			<HasPeers minimum={2} />
		</And>
	</When>
	<SyncNow />
</ConditionalSync>
```

## Conflict Visualization

Built-in components for understanding CRDT convergence:

### ConflictVisualizer

Shows real-time divergence and merge of distributed state:

```tsx
<ConflictVisualizer target="#todos">
	<ShowDivergence>
		<HighlightConflicts color="red" />
		<ShowVectorClocks />
		<DisplayMergeStrategy />
	</ShowDivergence>
	<AnimateMerge duration={500} />
	<ShowResolution>
		<ExplainMergeDecision />
		<HighlightWinner color="green" />
	</ShowResolution>
</ConflictVisualizer>
```

### VectorClockInspector

Displays causality relationships between events:

```tsx
<VectorClockInspector id="causality">
	<ShowTimeline>
		<NodeColumn for="each-peer" />
		<DrawArrows for="causal-dependencies" />
		<HighlightConcurrent color="yellow" />
	</ShowTimeline>
	<InteractiveMode>
		<HoverToSeeDetails />
		<ClickToFilterEvents />
		<ZoomAndPan />
	</InteractiveMode>
</VectorClockInspector>
```

### StateHistory

Enables time-travel debugging through distributed state evolution:

```tsx
<StateHistory target="#appState">
	<Timeline>
		<ShowSnapshots every={1000} />
		<ShowOperations between="snapshots" />
		<MarkConflicts with="⚠️" />
	</Timeline>
	<TimeTravel>
		<Slider min={0} max="now" />
		<PlaybackSpeed factor={1} />
		<JumpTo snapshot="any" />
	</TimeTravel>
	<DiffView>
		<ShowChanges from="selected" to="selected+1" />
		<HighlightAdditions color="green" />
		<HighlightDeletions color="red" />
	</DiffView>
</StateHistory>
```

### MergeStrategyVisualizer

Explains how different CRDT types resolve conflicts:

```tsx
<MergeStrategyVisualizer type="or-set">
	<ShowScenario>
		<Peer id="alice">
			<Add element="x" at="t1" />
			<Remove element="x" at="t3" />
		</Peer>
		<Peer id="bob">
			<Add element="x" at="t2" />
		</Peer>
	</ShowScenario>
	<ShowMerge>
		<Step>Alice adds x → {x}</Step>
		<Step>Bob adds x → {x}</Step>
		<Step>Alice removes x → {}</Step>
		<Step>Merge: Add wins → {x}</Step>
	</ShowMerge>
	<Interactive>
		<ModifyScenario />
		<SeeResult />
	</Interactive>
</MergeStrategyVisualizer>
```

### Integration with the-workshop

The workshop provides a visual playground for CRDT experimentation:

```tsx
<CrdtPlayground>
	<SelectType from={["counter", "lww-register", "or-set", "rga"]} />
	<SimulatePeers count={3} />
	<DefineOperations>
		<Draggable operations={true} />
		<ReorderOperations />
		<SimulateNetworkDelay />
		<InjectPartitions />
	</DefineOperations>
	<Visualize>
		<StateEvolution />
		<ConflictResolution />
		<FinalState />
	</Visualize>
	<ExportScenario as="test-case" />
</CrdtPlayground>
```

## Complete Application Examples

}
```

## Privacy & Security Components

### Homomorphic Computation

```jsx
// Compute on encrypted data without decrypting
<PrivateComputation id="salary-average">
	<HomomorphicSum>
		<From.Peers selector="#encrypted-salary" />
	</HomomorphicSum>
	<Divide by={<PeerCount />} />
	<RevealOnly when="threshold-met" threshold={10} />
</PrivateComputation>
```

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

```jsx
// Prove facts without revealing data
<ZkProof id="age-verification">
	<Prove>
		<IsGreaterThan>
			<Referent>
				<From.Private key="age" />
			</Referent>
			<Comparand>
				<From.Constant>18</From.Constant>
			</Comparand>
		</IsGreaterThan>
	</Prove>
	<Without revealing="age" />
</ZKProof>
```

### Selective Disclosure

```jsx
// Share only what's necessary
<SelectiveShare id="profile">
	<ShareWith peer="merchant">
		<Field name="shippingAddress" />
		<Field name="paymentVerified" />
	</ShareWith>
	<ShareWith peer="friend">
		<Field name="nickname" />
		<Field name="avatar" />
	</ShareWith>
	<Default>
		<Field name="publicKey" />
	</Default>
</SelectiveShare>
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Event Sourcing

```jsx
<EventSourcedState id="account">
	<Events>
		<Append only={true} />
		<SignEach with="#user.key" />
		<ChainWith hash="sha256" />
	</Events>
	<Replay from="genesis">
		<ValidateChain />
		<BuildState />
	</Replay>
	<Snapshot every={100} to="IPFS" />
</EventSourcedState>
```

### Federated Learning

```jsx
<FederatedModel id="recommendation">
	<LocalTraining data="#user-actions" />
	<ShareGradients not="data">
		<WithPeers trusted={true} />
		<DifferentialPrivacy />
	</ShareGradients>
	<AggregateModel when="round-complete" />
</FederatedModel>
```

### Consensus Mechanisms

```jsx
<DistributedDecision id="governance">
	<VotingMechanism>
		<QuadraticVoting />
		<MinQuorum percentage={30} />
		<Duration days={7} />
	</VotingMechanism>
	<Implementation>
		<When passed={true}>
			<ExecuteProposal />
			<RecordOnChain />
		</When>
	</Implementation>
</DistributedDecision>
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Lazy Synchronization

```jsx
<LazySync id="large-dataset">
	<PrioritizeBy>
		<ViewportVisible />
		<RecentlyModified />
		<FrequentlyAccessed />
	</PrioritizeBy>
	<BatchSize>100</BatchSize>
	<Compression>brotli</Compression>
</LazySync>
```

### Intelligent Caching

```jsx
<SmartCache id="distributed-cache">
	<Strategy>
		<LRU maxItems={1000} />
		<TTL seconds={3600} />
		<Prefetch based="patterns" />
	</Strategy>
	<Invalidation>
		<OnPeerUpdate />
		<OnSchemaChange />
	</Invalidation>
</SmartCache>
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install
deno add @sitebender/agent
```

### Basic Setup

```typescript
// Configure JSX
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "@sitebender/architect"
  }
}
```

### Quick Start

```tsx
import DistributedCounter from "@sitebender/agent/components/crdt/DistributedCounter/index.ts"
import SyncWith from "@sitebender/agent/components/sync/SyncWith/index.ts"
import render from "@sitebender/architect/render/index.ts"

function App() {
	return (
		<DistributedCounter id="sharedCount">
			<InitialValue>0</InitialValue>
			<SyncWith.Peers />
			<IncrementButton>+1</IncrementButton>
		</DistributedCounter>
	)
}

render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))
```

## Architectural Principles

### 1. **Local-First, Always**

Every component works offline. Network is enhancement, not requirement.

### 2. **Semantic by Design**

All data has meaning via RDF/ontologies. Not just key-value pairs.

### 3. **Privacy is Not Optional**

E2E encryption, local keys, no tracking, no surveillance.

### 4. **Declarative Everything**

No imperative sync code. Declare what you want, get distribution.

### 5. **Zero Configuration**

Smart defaults. It just works. Override only when needed.

### 6. **Progressive Enhancement**

Start with local state. Add sync. Add encryption. Add consensus.

## Why Agent + Architect Changes Everything

Traditional "distributed" apps:

- Need servers ($$$)
- Need DevOps (more $$$)
- Break when offline
- Leak user data
- Complex sync logic
- Corporate controlled

Agent + Architect apps:

- No servers needed
- No DevOps required
- Work offline always
- User owns data
- Sync is automatic
- People controlled

## The Revolution

This isn't Web3 crypto nonsense. This is the web returning to its roots:

- **Decentralized** like email
- **Resilient** like BitTorrent
- **Private** like Signal
- **Semantic** like the original web vision
- **Simple** like HTML should be

When you combine Agent with Architect, you get something unprecedented:
**Full-stack distributed applications written purely in JSX**.

No backend. No DevOps. No surveillance capitalism.

Just people, connecting directly, owning their data, building the future.

## Collaborative Workflow Editing

Agent's CRDT capabilities transform workflow design from a single-user experience to real-time collaborative system architecture, like Google Docs for distributed systems design.

### Real-Time Collaborative Workflow Canvas

Multiple architects, developers, and operators can simultaneously design and modify workflows with automatic conflict resolution:

```tsx
<CollaborativeWorkflowEditor>
  <Participants>
    <User id="system-architect" cursor={{ x: 245, y: 130 }}
          color="blue" role="architect" />
    <User id="lead-developer" selection={["node-warden-1"]}
          color="green" role="developer" />
    <User id="site-reliability" editing="connection-props"
          color="red" role="sre" />
    <User id="security-engineer" annotation="security-review"
          color="purple" role="security" />
  </Participants>
  
  <SharedCanvas>
    <WorkflowNodes>
      <Node id="warden" position={[300, 200]} owner="system-architect" />
      <Node id="steward" position={[500, 200]} owner="lead-developer" />
      <Node id="sentinel" position={[400, 100]} owner="security-engineer" />
    </WorkflowNodes>
    
    <Connections>
      <Connection from="warden" to="steward" owner="system-architect" />

```

### Distributed Workflow State

Workflows are stored as distributed CRDTs, enabling seamless collaboration across geographic boundaries:

```tsx
<DistributedWorkflowState>
  <CrdtWorkflow id="ci-cd-pipeline">
    <OrMap>
      <Field name="stages" type="ORSet">
        <Item id="parse" type="LWWRegister">
          <Properties>
            <Property name="executor" value="arborist" />
            <Property name="timeout" value="PT2M" />

            <Property name="dependsOn" value="parse" />
            <Property name="retryPolicy" value="exponential" />
          </Properties>
        </Item>
      </Field>
      
      <Field name="connections" type="ORSet">
        <Connection from="parse" to="validate" type="data-flow" />
        <Connection from="validate" to="deploy" type="conditional"
                    condition="violations.length === 0" />
      </Field>
      
      <Field name="metadata" type="LWWRegister">
        <Property name="owner" value="team-alpha" />

### Performance Benefits

Agent's collaborative workflow editing provides enterprise-grade performance:

- **Real-time collaboration**: < 50ms latency for local changes
- **Global synchronization**: < 200ms for cross-region updates
- **Conflict resolution**: < 10ms for automatic merges
- **Offline capability**: Unlimited offline operation duration
- **Concurrent users**: 100+ simultaneous editors per workflow
- **Workflow complexity**: 1000+ nodes with maintained performance

This transforms Agent from a distributed data tool into a **collaborative architecture design platform** that enables teams to work together on complex systems with the same ease as editing a shared document.

## What Agent Actually Does

After reading the Agent README, I now understand what this library provides:

### Agent = Distributed Web Components via JSX

**Core Capabilities:**
1. **CRDT Components** - Conflict-free distributed data structures (counters, sets, maps, text)
2. **P2P Networking** - Peer discovery, encrypted channels, WebRTC/WebSocket
3. **Decentralized Identity** - DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, Solid pods
4. **Distributed Storage** - IPFS, Solid, IndexedDB with multi-tier fallbacks
5. **Privacy/Security** - E2E encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic computation
6. **Semantic Web** - RDF triple stores, SPARQL queries, ontologies
7. **Collaborative Editing** - Real-time multi-user workflows with conflict resolution

### The Key Insight: This is NOT the Actor Model

Agent is based on:
- **CRDTs** (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)
- **Event sourcing**
- **P2P networking**
- **Distributed state synchronization**

It's **not** the Actor model (isolated actors passing messages). It's more like:
- **GUN.js** (graph synchronization)
- **Automerge** (CRDT library)
- **Yjs** (collaborative editing)

But entirely in JSX.

---

## Folder Naming Analysis

### Why "connections" Works Well

Agent is about:
- Connecting to **peers** (P2P)
- Connecting to **storage** (IPFS, Solid)
- Connecting to **identity providers** (DIDs)
- **Synchronizing** across connections
- **Collaborating** via connections

**`connections/`** captures all of this without being technical.

### Why NOT "actors"

1. **Wrong model** - Agent uses CRDTs, not Actor model
2. **Confusing** - "actors" could mean:
   - Actor model (Erlang/Akka style)
   - AI agents (your concern!)
   - User actors (people using the system)
   - Actors in auth systems

### Why NOT "agents"

Your instinct is **100% correct**:
- **AI confusion** - "agents" will immediately suggest AI agents
- **Library name collision** - The library is already called "Agent"
- **Future-proofing** - You might actually need an `agents/` folder for AI agents later

### Alternative Considerations

**`network/`** - Too technical, implies infrastructure
**`distributed/`** - Too technical, users don't know what "distributed" means
**`sync/`** - Too narrow, Agent does more than just sync
**`peers/`** - Too narrow, also connects to servers (Solid, IPFS)
**`collaboration/`** - Good but incomplete, Agent does more than collaboration
**`remote/`** - Implies centralized servers, opposite of P2P philosophy

---

## My Recommendation

**Stick with `connections/`**

It's:
- ✅ User-friendly
- ✅ Accurate (covers P2P, storage, identity, sync)
- ✅ Not technical jargon
- ✅ No ambiguity
- ✅ Future-proof (won't conflict with AI agents folder)

---

## Should Agent Use the Actor Model?

### Current Architecture (CRDTs + Event Sourcing)

**Strengths:**
- Automatic conflict resolution
- Offline-first by design
- Eventually consistent
- Simple mental model for users
- Proven in collaborative editing

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited to specific CRDT types
- Can't model all distributed patterns
- Harder to reason about ordering

### If You Added Actor Model

**Would Enable:**
- Explicit message passing
- Location transparency
- Supervision trees (fault tolerance)
- Process isolation
- Traditional distributed patterns

**But:**
- More complex for users
- Harder to express in JSX
- Doesn't fit "everything is data" philosophy
- Less automatic (more manual coordination)

### My Take

**Don't add Actor model to Agent.** Here's why:

1. **Different paradigm** - Actors are about message-passing processes, Agent is about distributed data
2. **User complexity** - CRDTs are "magic" (just works), Actors require understanding processes/mailboxes
3. **Fits the vision** - "Everything is data" → CRDTs are data, Actors are processes
4. **If you need Actors** - That's a different library (maybe `@sitebender/actors` for advanced users)

Agent should stay focused on: **"I want this data synchronized across devices, just make it work"**

If users need Actor-style coordination, that's probably **Operator** (pub/sub, event sourcing, workflow orchestration).

# Custodian

State management that respects the web's fundamental architecture. Works without JavaScript, enhances progressively, and treats the server as the source of truth.

## Philosophy

Custodian rejects the modern antipattern of duplicating server state on the client. Instead, it embraces the web's original design: stateless requests with state encoded in URLs and forms. When JavaScript is available, Custodian intercepts these interactions for optimistic updates and offline support, but the fundamental model remains unchanged.

Every interaction works identically with or without JavaScript:

- **Lynx/Mosaic**: Form submission → server processes → new page
- **Modern browser (no JS)**: Same as above
- **Modern browser (JS)**: Form submission → preventDefault → local state update → background sync

## Core Concepts

### Idempotent Operations

All state mutations use UUID-based idempotent operations. Forms include server-generated UUIDs that guarantee exactly-once semantics:

```typescript
//++ Transforms HTML form into idempotent operation
export function deriveOperation(form: HTMLFormElement): Operation {
	const method = getFormMethod(form)
	const uuid = getFormUUID(form)

	if (isNil(uuid)) {
		return Left(new Error("All operations require a UUID"))
	}

	return Right({
		id: uuid,
		method: method,
		idempotencyKey: uuid,
		resource: extractResourcePath(form),
		data: new FormData(form),
	})
}
```

### URL as State Container

UI state lives entirely in the URL. Every UI interaction is a navigation:

```
/dashboard
  ?accordion=2          // Which accordion is open
  &tab=settings        // Active tab
  &sort=date           // Table sort
  &order=asc           // Sort order
  &filters=active,new  // Active filters
  &page=3              // Current page
  #row-42              // Scroll position
```

The server reads this URL and renders the appropriate state. With JavaScript, we intercept navigation and update locally.

### Continuations for Complex Flows

Form wizards and multi-step processes use cryptographically signed continuation tokens:

```typescript
//++ Secure continuation for resumable workflows
type WizardContinuation = {
	step: number
	data: Record<string, unknown> // Accumulated data
	remaining: Array<number> // Steps left
	rollback: string // Previous continuation
	expires: number // Time-bound
	nonce: string // Prevent replay
	signature: string // Tamper-proof
}
```

Users can bookmark a form halfway through and resume weeks later. The continuation is the computation frozen in time.

### State Machines

All state transitions follow pure, declarative state machines:

```typescript
//++ State machine definition
type StateMachine<S, E> = {
	id: string
	initial: S
	states: {
		[K in S]: {
			on: {
				[Event in E]?: {
					target: S
					guard?: string
					actions?: Array<string>
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

State machines work identically server-side (from form submissions) or client-side (from intercepted events).

## Progressive Enhancement Architecture

### Layer 0: Pure HTML (No JavaScript)

```html
<!-- State in URL -->
<a href="/app?tab=profile">Profile</a>

<!-- State via forms -->
<form method="POST" action="/api/items">
	<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT" />
	<input type="hidden" name="_uuid" value="550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716" />
	<input name="title" required />
	<button>Save</button>
</form>
```

### Layer 1: Enhanced with JavaScript

```typescript
//++ Intercepts forms for local state management
export function enhanceForm(form: HTMLFormElement): void {
	const operation = deriveOperation(form)

	if (isLeft(operation)) {
		return
	}

	form.addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
		e.preventDefault()

		// Apply optimistically
		applyOperationLocally(operation.value)

		// Queue for sync (works offline)
		queueOperation(operation.value)

		// Update URL for shareability
		updateURL(operation.value)
	})
}
```

## Security & Privacy

### Signed Continuations

All continuations are cryptographically signed and time-bound:

```typescript
//++ Creates tamper-proof continuation
export function signContinuation(
	data: WizardContinuation,
	secret: string,
): string {
	const payload = toJson(0)(data)
	const signature = hashHex(concat(payload)(secret))

	return concat(base64Encode(payload))(".")(base64Encode(signature))
}
```

### Privacy-Aware State

```typescript
//++ State classification for privacy
type PrivacyAwareState = {
	public: Record<string, unknown> // Can go in URL
	private: Record<string, unknown> // Server-side only
	ephemeral: Record<string, unknown> // Never persisted
}
```

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Sensitive data stays server-side with only proof of validity exposed:

```typescript
//++ Zero-knowledge resumption token
export function createResumptionToken(state: PrivacyAwareState): string {
	const proof = hashPrivateData(state.private)

	return signToken({
		public: state.public,
		proof, // Verify without exposing
		expires: add(Date.now())(86400000),
	})
}
```

## Integration

### With Architect

Custodian triggers Architect's reactive behaviors via DOM events:

```typescript
//++ Triggers Architect calculations after state change
function notifyArchitect(element: HTMLElement): void {
	const event = new InputEvent("input", {
		bubbles: true,
		cancelable: true,
	})
	element.dispatchEvent(event)
}
```

### With Agent

State operations become distributed CRDT operations:

```typescript
//++ Converts operations to CRDT format
export function toCRDTOperation(op: Operation): CRDTOperation {
	return {
		id: op.id,
		type: op.method,
		timestamp: now(),
		payload: objectFromFormData(op.data),
		vector: getCurrentVectorClock(),
	}
}
```

### With Triple Store

Forms generate SPARQL updates:

```typescript
//++ Generates SPARQL from form submission
export function toSparqlUpdate(operation: Operation): string {
	const uuid = operation.id
	const triples = formDataToTriples(operation.data)

	return buildSparqlInsert(uuid)(triples)
}
```

## API

### Core Functions

```typescript
//++ Creates a Custodian instance
export function createCustodian(config: CustodianConfig): Custodian

//++ Derives operation from HTML form
export function deriveOperation(
	form: HTMLFormElement,
): Either<Error, Operation>

//++ Signs continuation for secure resumption
export function signContinuation(
	data: WizardContinuation,
	secret: string,
): string

//++ Verifies and deserializes continuation
export function verifyContinuation(
	token: string,
	secret: string,
): Either<SecurityError, WizardContinuation>

//++ Updates URL with new UI state
export function updateUIState(
	current: URL,
	updates: Record<string, string | null>,
): URL

//++ Applies state machine transition
export function transition<S, E>(
	machine: StateMachine<S, E>,
	current: SecureState<S>,
	event: E,
): Either<SecurityError, SecureState<S>>
```

### Configuration

```typescript
type CustodianConfig = {
	encryption: boolean // Enable encryption
	signing: boolean // Sign all operations
	sessionBinding: boolean // Bind to session
	expirationMinutes: number // Token expiration
	maxContinuationSize: number // Prevent DoS
	allowedOrigins: Array<string> // CORS protection
	sameSite: "strict" | "lax" // Cookie policy
	secure: boolean // HTTPS only
	httpOnly: boolean // Cookie access
}
```

## Examples

### Multi-Step Form Wizard

```typescript
//++ Wizard with continuations
const wizardMachine: StateMachine<WizardState, WizardEvent> = {
	id: "onboarding",
	initial: "name",
	states: {
		name: {
			on: {
				NEXT: { target: "address", guard: "hasValidName" },
				SAVE: { target: "suspended", actions: ["saveContinuation"] },
			},
		},
		address: {
			on: {
				NEXT: { target: "payment" },
				BACK: { target: "name" },
			},
		},
		suspended: {
			on: {
				RESUME: { target: "name", actions: ["restoreContinuation"] },
			},
		},
	},
}
```

### UI State Management

```typescript
//++ Accordion state in URL
export function toggleAccordion(current: URL, accordionId: string): URL {
	const isOpen = equals(current.searchParams.get("accordion"))(accordionId)

	return updateUIState(current, {
		accordion: isOpen ? null : accordionId,
	})
}
```

### Offline-First Operations

```typescript
//++ Queue operations for eventual consistency
export function queueOperation(operation: Operation): Promise<void> {
	const queue = getOperationQueue()
	const enriched = {
		...operation,
		timestamp: now(),
		retryCount: 0,
	}

	return queue.add(enriched)
}
```

## Benefits

- **Universal**: Works in Lynx, Mosaic, or modern browsers
- **Resumable**: Bookmark and resume complex workflows
- **Shareable**: URL contains complete UI state
- **Offline-capable**: Queue operations, sync when connected
- **Secure**: Signed, encrypted, time-bound tokens
- **Idempotent**: UUID-based operations prevent duplicates
- **Progressive**: Same model with or without JavaScript
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript with functional patterns

## Visual State Machine Workflow System

Custodian's state machines become the foundation for visual workflow design, bringing n8n-style visual editing to state management with Sitebender's semantic triple store architecture.

### Visual State Machine Designer

Transform complex state logic into intuitive visual workflows:

```tsx
<StateMachineWorkflowCanvas>
  <StateMachineDesigner id="user-onboarding">

      </ReconnectionFlow>
    </OnNetworkPartition>
  </RecoveryPolicies>
</WorkflowStateRecovery>
```

### State Machine Analytics and Optimization

Analyze state machine performance with visual insights:

```tsx
<StateMachineAnalytics>
  <FlowAnalytics>
    <StateUtilization>
      <HeatMap states={true} transitions={true} />
      <UsageStatistics>
        <MostVisitedStates />

      <TransitionOptimization for="frequent-paths" />
    </AutoOptimization>
  </PerformanceOptimization>
</StateMachineAnalytics>
```

### Integration with Workflow Systems

State machines integrate seamlessly with broader workflow systems:

```tsx
<WorkflowIntegration>
  <WorkflowToStateMachine>
    <WorkflowStage name="user-onboarding">
      <EmbeddedStateMachine ref="user-onboarding-fsm" />
      <StateCallbacks>
        <OnStateEnter callback="logUserProgress" />
        <OnStateExit callback="updateMetrics" />
        <OnCompletion callback="triggerNextWorkflowStage" />
      </StateCallbacks>
    </WorkflowStage>
  </WorkflowToStateMachine>
  
  <CrossWorkflowCommunication>
    <StateMachineEvents>
      <PublishEvent when="state-changed" to="operator.events" />
      <SubscribeToEvent from="external-system" trigger="state-transition" />
    </StateMachineEvents>
    
    <WorkflowOrchestration>
      <ConditionalWorkflows>
        <TriggerWorkflow when="state === 'completed'"
                        workflow="post-onboarding-tasks" />
        <BlockWorkflow when="state === 'suspended'"
                      workflow="user-activation-emails" />
      </ConditionalWorkflows>
    </WorkflowOrchestration>
  </CrossWorkflowCommunication>
</WorkflowIntegration>
```

### State Machine as Data

Like all Sitebender components, state machines are stored as semantic data:

```turtle
@prefix fsm: <https://sitebender.studio/custodian#> .
@prefix workflow: <https://sitebender.studio/workflow#> .

<fsm:user-onboarding> a fsm:StateMachine ;
  fsm:initialState <state:initial> ;
  fsm:states <state:initial>, <state:profile-setup>, <state:completed> ;
  workflow:partOf <workflow:user-activation-pipeline> .

<state:initial> a fsm:State ;
  fsm:type "start" ;
  fsm:position [fsm:x 100; fsm:y 200] ;
  fsm:onEnter "generateToken", "sendWelcomeEmail" ;
  fsm:transitionsTo <transition:email-verified> .

<transition:email-verified> a fsm:Transition ;
  fsm:from <state:initial> ;
  fsm:to <state:profile-setup> ;
  fsm:event "email-verified" ;
  fsm:visualPath "bezier" ;
  fsm:color "blue" .
```

This transforms Custodian from a simple state management library into a **visual state machine design and execution platform** that enables complex workflow orchestration with intuitive visual design tools.

## Philosophy Redux

Custodian isn't trying to be clever. It's returning to the web's roots: stateless HTTP, semantic HTML, progressive enhancement. The radical idea is that we never needed to abandon these principles. We just needed to implement them correctly.

State isn't something to be "managed" - it's something to be transformed through pure functions, encoded in URLs, and synchronized via idempotent operations. The browser already has a state machine (the history API), a persistence layer (URLs), and a synchronization protocol (HTTP). Custodian simply orchestrates these existing pieces into a coherent whole.

With the addition of visual state machine workflows, Custodian bridges the gap between the web's stateless foundation and modern application complexity - providing the tools to design, visualize, and manage complex state flows while never abandoning the web's core principles.

The future of web development isn't more complexity - it's rediscovering the elegant simplicity that was there all along, enhanced with the tools to handle complexity when truly necessary.

# Operator

Pure functional pub/sub system enabling reactive communication through declarative TSX components. Events flow as triples through a multi-layer transport fabric that scales seamlessly from local DOM events to distributed global systems.

## Overview

Operator treats events as first-class data in Studio's triple store architecture. Every event is a triple (subject-predicate-object), making your entire event history queryable via SPARQL, perfectly reproducible, and cryptographically verifiable.

## Installation

```typescript
import Channel from "@sitebender/operator/components/Channel/index.ts"
import Publishes from "@sitebender/operator/components/Publishes/index.ts"
import Subscribes from "@sitebender/operator/components/Subscribes/index.ts"
```

## Core Concepts

### Events as Triples

All events in Operator are RDF triples stored in the triple store:

```tsx
<Publisher
	subject="user-123"
	predicate="clicked"
	object="button-save"
	timestamp="temporal"
/>
```

This enables:

- SPARQL queries over event history
- Time-travel debugging
- Perfect event replay
- Cryptographic verification

### Transport Layers

Operator automatically selects optimal transport based on scope:

1. **Local** (same tab): Custom DOM events with WeakMap registry
2. **Broadcast** (cross-tab): BroadcastChannel with localStorage fallback
3. **Network** (cross-device): WebTransport (HTTP/3) → WebRTC → WebSocket fallback chain
4. **Distributed** (global): libp2p pubsub with IPFS content addressing

## Basic Usage

### Publishing Events

```tsx
<Channel id="user-actions" scope="local">
	<Button>
		<Publishes event="click" as="user:clicked:button" />
		Save
	</Button>
</Channel>
```

### Subscribing to Events

```tsx
<Panel>
	<Subscribes to="user:clicked:*" then={<Effect apply={updatePanel} />} />
</Panel>
```

### Event Transformation

```tsx
<Button>
	<Publishes
		event="click"
		as="payment:initiated"
		with={<Transform map={clickToPayment} />}
	/>
	Pay Now
</Button>
```

### Event Filtering

```tsx
<Dashboard>
	<Subscribes
		to="metrics:*"
		when={<Filter match={isAboveThreshold} />}
		then={<Effect apply={showAlert} />}
	/>
</Dashboard>
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Cross-Scope Bridging

Connect different transport layers seamlessly:

```tsx
<Bridge from="local:user-actions" to="broadcast:user-actions">
	<Encrypt with="nacl-box" for={["did:key:xyz", "did:key:abc"]} />
</Bridge>
```

### Monadic Event Pipelines

Compose complex event processing with Toolsmith monads:

```tsx
<Subscribes to="sensor:reading">
	<Pipe>
		<Map with={parseReading} />
		<Filter with={isValid} />
		<FlatMap with={enrichWithContext} />
		<Fold with={calculateAverage} into={0} />
		<Fork>
			<Left>
				<Log to="metrics" />
			</Left>
			<Right>
				<Render to="display" />
			</Right>
		</Fork>
	</Pipe>
</Subscribes>
```

### Temporal Event Lattices

Events form a partially ordered lattice with vector clocks:

```tsx
<Channel id="collaborative" ordering="causal">
	<VectorClock />
	<CrdtMerge strategy="lww-element-set" />
</Channel>
```

### Homomorphic Processing

Process encrypted events without decryption:

```tsx
<Subscribes to="salary:updated">
	<HomomorphicSum
		compute="average"
		without="decrypting"
		reveal="only-to-authorized"
	/>
</Subscribes>
```

### Quantum Superposition

Events exist in superposition until observed:

```tsx
<Publisher entangled="true">
	<Superpose states={["saved", "saving", "error"]} />
	<Collapse when={<Observe by="user-interface" />} />
</Publisher>
```

## Security & Privacy

### Capability-Based Authorization

```tsx
<Capability
	issuer="did:key:publisher"
	bearer="did:key:subscriber"
	allows={["subscribe", "replay"]}
	expires="PT1H"
/>
```

### Ring Signatures

Anonymous publishing with cryptographic proof of group membership:

```tsx
<Publisher anonymous="ring">
	<RingMembers did={["alice", "bob", "carol"]} />
	<Publishes event="whistleblower:report" />
</Publisher>
```

### Differential Privacy

Add calibrated noise for privacy-preserving analytics:

```tsx
<Analytics epsilon="1.0">
	<Subscribes to="*" aggregate="count" noise="laplacian" />
</Analytics>
```

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Verify event properties without revealing content:

```tsx
<Subscribes to="transaction:*">
	<VerifyProof that="amount > 1000" without="revealing-amount" />
</Subscribes>
```

## Smart Contract Events

Execute deterministic computations on events:

```tsx
<Channel blockchain="local-first">
	<SmartEvent
		condition="balance > 100"
		execute="transfer"
		verify="zero-knowledge"
	/>
</Channel>
```

## Neural Event Routing

```tsx
<Optimizer mode="neural">
	<Learn from="event-history" />
	<Predict next="likely-subscribers" />
	<Preload components={predicted} />
</Optimizer>
```

## Server-Side Usage

Identical TSX components work server-side with Deno:

```tsx
<Server transport="quic">
	<Channel id="global">
		<Subscribes to="client:*" from="anywhere" />
		<Publishes to="client:*" everywhere="true" />
	</Channel>
</Server>
```

## WebAssembly Modules

Performance-critical operations run in WASM:

- **Crypto**: libsodium-wasm for all cryptographic operations
- **CRDT**: Automerge-wasm for conflict-free replicated data
- **Routing**: High-performance event routing tables
- **Compression**: Zstandard dictionary compression for event streams

## Testing

Operator integrates with Studio's declarative testing:

```tsx
<TestHarness>
	<MockPublisher id="test-source">
		<EmitSequence events={testEvents} timing="realistic" />
	</MockPublisher>

	<AssertSubscriber to="test:*">
		<Receives exactly={3} within="PT1S" />
		<Ordering is="causal" />
	</AssertSubscriber>
</TestHarness>
```

## Debugging

### Event Replay

```tsx
<Replay from="2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" to="2024-01-01T01:00:00Z">
	<Speed factor={10} />
	<Filter match={debugPredicate} />
</Replay>
```

### Visual Event Flow

The Workshop provides real-time visualization of event flow through your DAG, with filters, breakpoints, and time-travel debugging.

## Performance Measurement

Every event includes timing metadata stored as triples:

- Latency at each transport layer
- Throughput measurements
- Queue depths and backpressure
- All queryable via SPARQL for trend analysis

### Real Metrics, Not Marketing

Operator measures actual performance in production:

```tsx
<PerformanceMonitor>
	<Measure latency="p50,p90,p99" />
	<Measure throughput="events/second" />
	<Measure backpressure="queue-depth" />
	<StoreTo triple-store="metrics" />
</PerformanceMonitor>
```

Query your actual performance:

```sparql
SELECT ?transport ?p99_latency
WHERE {
  ?event op:transport ?transport ;
         op:latency_p99 ?p99_latency ;
         op:timestamp ?time .
  FILTER(?time > NOW() - "PT1H"^^xsd:duration)
}
```

### Baseline Performance Targets

- **Local events**: < 1μs latency
- **Broadcast**: < 1ms latency
- **Network**: < 10ms latency (same region)
- **Distributed**: < 100ms latency (global)
- **Throughput**: 1M+ events/second (local), 100K+ events/second (network)

## Integration with Studio Libraries

### Architect

Operator events trigger DOM updates through Architect's reactive pipeline without VDOM overhead.

### Agent

Distributed events sync through Agent's CRDT adapters for eventual consistency.

### Warden

All event permissions enforced by Warden's capability-based contracts.

### Envoy

Complete event observability through Envoy's documentation graph.

### Auditor

Mathematical proofs verify event ordering and causality invariants.

### Sentinel

Authentication and authorization for event streams via DIDs and VCs.

### Formulator

Dynamic event expressions compiled from formulas.

## Examples

### Real-time Collaboration

```tsx
<Document collaborative="true">
	<Channel scope="network" ordering="causal">
		<Publishes event="cursor:moved" throttle="16ms" />
		<Publishes event="text:changed" debounce="300ms" />
		<Subscribes to="peer:cursor:*" then={<ShowCursor />} />
		<Subscribes to="peer:text:*" then={<MergeText />} />
	</Channel>
</Document>
```

### IoT Sensor Network

```tsx
<SensorNetwork>
	<Channel scope="distributed" transport="mqtt">
		<Subscribes to="sensor:temperature:*">
			<Window size="PT5M" slide="PT1M">
				<Aggregate function="mean" />
				<Alert when={<Threshold above={30} />} />
			</Window>
		</Subscribes>
	</Channel>
</SensorNetwork>
```

### Financial Trading

```tsx
<TradingSystem>
	<Channel scope="network" priority="realtime">
		<Subscribes to="market:tick:*">
			<Pipe>
				<Map with={normalizePrice} />
				<Filter with={isSignificant} />
				<Fork>
					<Left>
						<Execute trade={strategy} />
					</Left>
					<Right>
						<Log to="audit-trail" />
					</Right>
				</Fork>
			</Pipe>
		</Subscribes>
	</Channel>
</TradingSystem>
```

## Event-Driven Workflow Engine

Operator's pub/sub system becomes the backbone of visual workflow execution, providing n8n-style event-driven triggers but with Sitebender's semantic triple store architecture and distributed capabilities.

### Workflow Triggers

Transform system events into workflow executions with declarative trigger components:

```tsx
<WorkflowTriggers>
  {/* Git change triggers */}
  <On event="git.push">
    <Filter>
      <Branch matches="main" />
      <HasFiles pattern="src/**/*.ts" />
    </Filter>
    <Trigger workflow="ci-pipeline" />
    <NotifyPeers via="agent.broadcast" />
  </On>

  {/* Warden violations */}
  <On event="warden.violation">
    <Classify severity={violation.level} />
    <When condition="severity >= 'error'">
      <BlockDeployment reason="architectural-violation" />
      <NotifyTeam channel="alerts" priority="high" />
    </When>
    <When condition="severity === 'warn'">
      <QueueWorkflow name="steward-autofix" />
    </When>
  </On>

  {/* Performance thresholds */}
  <On event="performance.degradation">
    <Measure baseline="last7days" />
    <When condition="p99 > baseline * 1.2">
      <TriggerWorkflow name="performance-investigation" />
      <ScaleResources target="compute" factor={1.5} />
    </When>
  </On>

  {/* Developer experience events */}
  <On event="developer.frustration" rating="😟">
    <AnalyzeContext window="PT15M" />
    <SuggestImprovements category="tooling" />
    <TrackResolution workflow="dev-experience-fix" />
  </On>

  {/* External API events */}
  <On event="webhook.received">
    <ValidatePayload schema="github-webhook" />
    <AuthenticateSource />
    <RouteToWorkflow based="payload.action" />
  </On>

  {/* Scheduled triggers */}
  <On schedule="0 2 * * *" timezone="UTC">
    <TriggerWorkflow name="daily-health-check" />
    <CleanupResources olderThan="P30D" />
  </On>
</WorkflowTriggers>
```

### Distributed Workflow Orchestration

Coordinate complex, multi-stage workflows across distributed systems:

```tsx
<DistributedWorkflow id="code-quality-pipeline">
  <Phases>
    <Phase name="parse" executor="arborist">
      <Input type="source-files" />
      <Output type="ast-data" />
      <Parallelization maxConcurrency={4} />
      <Timeout>PT3M</Timeout>
    </Phase>
    
    <Phase name="validate" executor="warden">
      <Input type="ast-data" />
      <Output type="violations" />
      <DependsOn phase="parse" />
      <RetryPolicy attempts={2} backoff="linear" />
    </Phase>
    
    <Phase name="test-generation" executor="auditor">
      <Input type="ast-data" />
      <Output type="test-results" />
      <Parallel with="validate" />
      <ResourceLimits memory="2GB" cpu="4 cores" />
    </Phase>
    
    <Phase name="documentation" executor="envoy">
      <Input type="ast-data" />
      <Input type="test-results" />
      <Output type="documentation" />
      <DependsOn phase="test-generation" />
      <CacheStrategy key="source-hash" ttl="PT1H" />
    </Phase>
  </Phases>
  
  <ErrorHandling>
    <OnFailure phase="parse" retry={3} backoff="exponential" />
    <OnFailure phase="validate" escalate="human-review" />
    <OnTimeout after="PT10M" cancel="gracefully" />
    <OnCancel cleanup="intermediate-artifacts" />
  </ErrorHandling>
  
  <Monitoring>
    <PhaseMetrics />
    <ResourceUsage />
    <DurationTracking />
    <ErrorRates />
  </Monitoring>
</DistributedWorkflow>
```

### Real-Time Event Processing

Process events as they flow through the system with reactive transformations:

```tsx
<EventProcessingPipeline>
  <Stream name="git-events">
    <Subscribe to="git.*" />
    <Transform>
      <ExtractMetadata fields={["author", "files", "branch"]} />
      <EnrichWithContext from="user-profile" />
      <ClassifyImpact based="file-importance" />
    </Transform>
    <Buffer size={100} flushInterval="PT5S" />
  </Stream>
  
  <Stream name="performance-events">
    <Subscribe to="metrics.*" />
    <Window type="sliding" size="PT5M" slide="PT30S" />
    <Aggregate>
      <Average field="latency" />
      <Percentile field="response-time" values={[50, 90, 99]} />
      <Count field="errors" />
    </Aggregate>
    <Detect>
      <Anomaly field="latency" threshold="3-sigma" />
      <Trend field="error-rate" direction="increasing" />
    </Detect>
  </Stream>
  
  <Stream name="workflow-events">
    <Subscribe to="workflow.*" />
    <Fork>
      <Left>
        <Filter condition="event.type === 'completed'" />
        <UpdateMetrics category="workflow-performance" />
      </Left>
      <Right>
        <Filter condition="event.type === 'failed'" />
        <TriggerIncidentResponse />
        <NotifyOnCall />
      </Right>
    </Fork>
  </Stream>
</EventProcessingPipeline>
```

### Workflow State Management

Maintain workflow execution state with automatic persistence and recovery:

```tsx
<WorkflowStateManager>
  <PersistenceStrategy>
    <Checkpoints>
      <AutoSave interval="PT30S" />
      <StateSnapshot on="phase-completion" />
      <IncrementalBackup on="significant-change" />
    </Checkpoints>
    
    <Storage>
      <TripleStore for="metadata" />
      <LocalStorage for="intermediate-results" />
      <DistributedCache for="shared-state" />
    </Storage>
  </PersistenceStrategy>
  
  <RecoveryPolicies>
    <OnCrash>
      <RestoreFromLastCheckpoint />
      <ReplayMissedEvents since="last-checkpoint" />
      <ValidateStateConsistency />
      <ResumeExecution from="safe-point" />
    </OnCrash>
    
    <OnNetworkPartition>
      <QueueOperations locally={true} />
      <ConflictResolutionOnReconnect strategy="crdt-merge" />
      <StateReconciliation with="distributed-peers" />
    </OnNetworkPartition>
    
    <OnResourceExhaustion>
      <PauseNonCriticalWorkflows />
      <ScaleResources if="auto-scaling-enabled" />
      <SpillOverToDistributedNodes />
    </OnResourceExhaustion>
  </RecoveryPolicies>
</WorkflowStateManager>
```

### Event-Driven Integration Patterns

Connect external systems through standardized event interfaces:

```tsx
<ExternalIntegrations>
  <GitHubIntegration>
    <Webhooks>
      <On event="push" />
      <On event="pull_request" />
      <On event="release" />
    </Webhooks>
    
    <EventTransformation>
      <Normalize payload="github-format" to="sitebender-format" />
      <ExtractRelevantData fields={["repository", "commit", "author"]} />
      <ValidateIntegrity signature="x-hub-signature" />
    </EventTransformation>
  </GitHubIntegration>
  
  <SlackIntegration>
    <Commands>
      <Command name="deploy" workflow="production-deployment" />
      <Command name="rollback" workflow="emergency-rollback" />
      <Command name="status" query="system-health" />
    </Commands>
    
    <Notifications>
      <WorkflowStarted channel="deployments" />
      <WorkflowCompleted channel="deployments" />
      <WorkflowFailed channel="alerts" />
    </Notifications>
  </SlackIntegration>
  
  <MonitoringIntegration>
    <AlertManager>
      <Subscribe to="alerts.*" />
      <Route>
        <Critical to="pager-duty" />
        <Warning to="team-slack" />
        <Info to="monitoring-dashboard" />
      </Route>
    </AlertManager>
    
    <MetricsCollection>
      <Publish to="prometheus" interval="PT15S" />
      <Publish to="datadog" interval="PT30S" />
      <Publish to="grafana" format="json" />
    </MetricsCollection>
  </MonitoringIntegration>
</ExternalIntegrations>
```

### Workflow Composition and Reuse

Build complex workflows from composable, reusable components:

```tsx
<WorkflowLibrary>
  <WorkflowTemplate name="secure-deployment">
    <Parameters>
      <Parameter name="environment" type="string" enum={["staging", "production"]} />
      <Parameter name="approvalRequired" type="boolean" default={true} />
      <Parameter name="rollbackWindow" type="duration" default="PT15M" />
    </Parameters>
    
    <Stages>
      <Stage name="security-scan" />
      <Stage name="approval-gate" if="${approvalRequired}" />
      <Stage name="deployment" />
      <Stage name="smoke-tests" />
      <Stage name="monitoring" duration="${rollbackWindow}" />
    </Stages>
  </WorkflowTemplate>
  
  <WorkflowTemplate name="data-processing">
    <Parameters>
      <Parameter name="inputSource" type="url" required={true} />
      <Parameter name="outputFormat" type="string" enum={["json", "csv", "parquet"]} />
      <Parameter name="batchSize" type="integer" default={1000} />
    </Parameters>
    
    <Processing>
      <Extract from="${inputSource}" />
      <Transform using="custom-logic" />
      <Load to="data-warehouse" format="${outputFormat}" batchSize="${batchSize}" />
    </Processing>
  </WorkflowTemplate>
  
  <WorkflowComposition>
    <Use template="secure-deployment" environment="production" />
    <Use template="data-processing" outputFormat="parquet" />
    <Connect output="data-processing.result" input="secure-deployment.artifact" />
  </WorkflowComposition>
</WorkflowLibrary>
```

### Performance and Scalability

Operator's workflow engine is designed for high-performance, distributed execution:

#### Event Processing Performance
- **Local events**: < 1μs latency
- **Distributed events**: < 10ms latency (same region)
- **Workflow triggers**: < 5ms cold start
- **Throughput**: 1M+ events/second (local), 100K+ events/second (distributed)

#### Scalability Features
```tsx
<ScalabilityFeatures>
  <HorizontalScaling>
    <AutoScale based="queue-depth" />
    <LoadBalancing algorithm="consistent-hashing" />
    <NodeDiscovery via="agent.peers" />
  </HorizontalScaling>
  
  <ResourceManagement>
    <ResourcePools cpu="4-16 cores" memory="2-32GB" />
    <QueueManagement backpressure="adaptive" />
    <CircuitBreakers for="external-services" />
  </ResourceManagement>
  
  <OptimizationStrategies>
    <EventBatching size="dynamic" />
    <ResultCaching ttl="intelligent" />
    <DeadLetterQueues for="failed-events" />
  </OptimizationStrategies>
</ScalabilityFeatures>
```

This transforms Operator from a simple pub/sub system into a **distributed workflow orchestration engine** that rivals enterprise solutions while maintaining Sitebender's semantic-first, "everything is data" philosophy.

> Pure functional property-based testing through compositional pipelines. Zero dependencies. Zero classes. Mathematical guarantees.

## What is Quarrier?

Quarrier is a revolutionary property-based testing library that treats testing as **algebraic pipeline composition**. Unlike traditional approaches with monadic overhead or deferred features, Quarrier delivers:

1. **Pipeline-Based Testing** - Properties are transformation pipelines: `Seed → Generate → Test → Shrink → Report`
2. **Bidirectional Generators** - Generate _and_ parse with the same logic for round-trip testing
3. **Proof-Carrying Properties** - Properties carry formal correctness proofs without HKT ceremony
4. **Metamorphic Testing** - Properties that derive other properties automatically
5. **Effects as Values** - Not IO monads, just data describing computations
6. **Lazy Shrink Trees** - From day one, not v1.1 - efficient minimal counterexamples immediately

Built with uncompromising functional principles:

- ZERO external dependencies
- ZERO classes or OOP
- ZERO mutation (except PRNG)
- ZERO null/undefined (Result monad)
- 100% pure functions
- 100% deterministic

## The Pipeline Paradigm

Property testing is fundamentally about transformation pipelines:

```typescript
//++ Generator protocol for pure, deterministic value generation
export type Generator<T> = {
  readonly next: (seed: Seed) => GeneratorResult<T>;
  readonly shrink: (value: T) => ShrinkTree<T>;
  readonly parse?: (input: unknown) => Result<T, ParseError>;
};

//++ Pipeline stage that transforms generators
export type Stage<A, B> = (gen: Generator<A>) => Generator<B>;

//++ Compose stages into pipelines
const pipeline = pipe(
  map((x) => x * 2),
  filter((x) => x > 0),
  shrinkToward(0),
);
```

This gives us:

- **Associativity**: Composition is mathematically sound
- **Identity**: The identity stage does nothing
- **Composition**: Build complex from simple

## Core Architecture

### 1. Effects as Values (Not Monads)

```typescript
//++ Effect descriptor for property testing
export type Effect<T> =
  | { readonly tag: "Pure"; readonly value: T }
  | { readonly tag: "Async"; readonly computation: () => Promise<T> }
  | { readonly tag: "IO"; readonly action: () => T }
  | { readonly tag: "Random"; readonly generator: Generator<T> };

//++ Properties return effects, not promises
export type Property<Args> = {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly generators: Generators<Args>;
  readonly predicate: (args: Args) => Effect<boolean>;
};
```

### 2. Bidirectional Generators

Generators that can parse enable powerful patterns:

```typescript
const email: Generator<string> = {
  next: (seed) => generateValidEmail(seed),
  shrink: (email) => shrinkEmail(email),
  parse: (input) => validateEmail(input), // Same validation logic!
};

// Automatic round-trip property
const emailRoundTrip = createProperty("email round-trips", [email], ([e]) =>
  Effect.Pure(email.parse!(e).isOk),
);
```

### 3. Proof-Carrying Properties

Properties carry formal proofs of correctness:

```typescript
export type PropertyProof<Args> = {
  readonly generators_deterministic: ProofOf<"deterministic", Args>;
  readonly shrink_terminates: ProofOf<"terminating", Args>;
  readonly shrink_sound: ProofOf<"sound", Args>;
};

export type ProvenProperty<Args> = {
  readonly property: Property<Args>;
  readonly proof: PropertyProof<Args>;
};
```

### 4. Metamorphic Testing

Properties that transform into other properties:

```typescript
const sortMetamorphic: Metamorphic<[number[]], [number[]]> = {
  source: sortProperty,
  derive: (prop) => [
    idempotenceProperty(prop), // Sorting twice = sorting once
    involutionProperty(prop), // reverse(sort(reverse(x))) = sort(x)
    lengthPreservingProperty(prop), // length unchanged
  ],
};
```

### 5. Resumable Shrinking

Shrink operations can be paused and resumed:

```typescript
export type ShrinkState<T> = {
  readonly tree: ShrinkTree<T>;
  readonly path: ReadonlyArray<number>; // Breadcrumb trail
  readonly visited: Set<string>; // Dedup via hashing
};

// Can pause, save, and resume shrinking across sessions
const session = resumeShrinking(state, predicate);
```

## Why Quarrier Wins

### vs Academic Approaches (HKTs, Monads)

- **No HKT Overhead**: TypeScript-native, not fighting the language
- **Better Performance**: Direct calls, not monadic chains
- **Clear Stack Traces**: No wrapper hell
- **Practical**: Real tools for real developers

### vs Pragmatic Approaches (Deferred Features)

- **Shrink Trees Day One**: Not waiting for v1.1
- **Effects as Values**: Not Promise normalization complexity
- **Bidirectional**: Parse and generate with same logic
- **Proof-Carrying**: Correctness guarantees built-in

### Novel Features Others Lack

- Bidirectional generators
- Metamorphic property derivation
- Resumable shrinking sessions
- Pipeline composition algebra
- Effects as values (not monads)

## Usage Examples

### Property Testing

```typescript
import { createProperty, checkProperty } from "@sitebender/quarrier";
import { integer } from "@sitebender/quarrier/generators";

// Mathematical law as property
const commutative = createProperty(
  "addition commutes",
  [integer(-100, 100), integer(-100, 100)],
  ([a, b]) => Effect.Pure(a + b === b + a),
);

// Check with automatic shrinking
const result = await checkProperty(commutative, { runs: 1000 });
// If fails: minimal counterexample like [0, 1] not [847, -923]
```

### Bidirectional Round-Trip Testing

```typescript
// One generator, two directions
const phoneNumber = createBidirectional({
  generate: (seed) => generatePhone(seed),
  parse: (input) => validatePhone(input),
  shrink: (phone) => simplifyPhone(phone),
});

// Automatic round-trip property
const phoneRoundTrip = createProperty(
  "phone formats round-trip",
  [phoneNumber],
  ([p]) => {
    const formatted = format(p);
    const parsed = phoneNumber.parse!(formatted);
    return Effect.Pure(parsed.isOk && normalize(parsed.value) === normalize(p));
  },
);
```

### Metamorphic Testing

```typescript
// Derive related properties automatically
const encryptionMeta = createMetamorphic(encryptProperty, {
  deriveInverse: true, // decrypt(encrypt(x)) = x
  deriveIdempotent: false, // encrypt not idempotent
  deriveCommutative: false, // order matters
  deriveDistributive: true, // distributes over concatenation
});

// Generates and checks all derived properties
const results = await checkMetamorphic(encryptionMeta);
```

## Implementation Status

See [docs/todos.md](docs/todos.md) for detailed implementation plan.

Current focus: **Pipeline architecture with immediate shrink trees**

## Design Principles

1. **Pipeline Composition** - Testing as algebraic transformation
2. **Effects as Values** - Not monads, just data
3. **Bidirectional by Design** - Parse and generate symmetrically

## Actor Model Analysis Across Libraries

After reading Custodian, Operator, and Quarrier, here's my assessment of whether the Actor model fits:

---

## **Custodian: NO - It's State Machines**

**What Custodian Actually Does:**
- **State machines** for multi-step workflows (wizards, forms)
- **URL as state** - stateless HTTP with state in query params
- **Cryptographic continuations** - resumable workflows frozen in time
- **Idempotent operations** - UUID-based exactly-once semantics
- **Progressive enhancement** - works without JS, enhances with it

**Architecture Pattern:**
- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**, not Actors
- Explicit states and transitions
- Event-driven state changes
- Visual workflow designer (n8n-style)

**Actor Model Fit:** ❌ **NO**
- State machines are about **transitions between states**
- Actors are about **isolated processes passing messages**
- Custodian already has the right model for its domain

---

## **Operator: MAYBE - But It's Pub/Sub**

**What Operator Actually Does:**
- **Pub/sub event system** with multi-layer transport
- **Events as RDF triples** in triple store
- **Multi-layer transport escalation**: DOM → BroadcastChannel → WebSocket → WebRTC → libp2p
- **Event sourcing** - immutable event log
- **Workflow orchestration** - distributed workflow execution

**Architecture Pattern:**
- **Event-driven pub/sub**, not Actors
- Events flow through channels
- Subscribers react to events
- SPARQL queryable event history

**Could Actor Model Apply?**
- Operator has **channels** (like Actor mailboxes)
- Operator has **message passing** (events)
- But it's **many-to-many pub/sub**, not **point-to-point Actor messaging**

**Actor Model Fit:** ⚠️ **MAYBE, but probably unnecessary**
- Current pub/sub model is simpler and more appropriate
- Actors would add complexity without clear benefit
- If you need location transparency and process isolation, Actors could work
- But Operator's event sourcing + CRDT integration already handles distributed coordination

---

## **Quarrier: NO - It's Property Testing**

**What Quarrier Actually Does:**
- **Property-based testing** via pipeline composition
- **Generator algebra** - compose generators via map/filter/chain
- **Bidirectional generators** - generate AND parse
- **Shrink trees** - find minimal counterexamples
- **Effects as values** - not monads, just data

**Architecture Pattern:**
- **Pipeline composition** (algebraic)
- **Lazy evaluation** (shrink trees)
- **Pure functions** (deterministic generation)

**Actor Model Fit:** ❌ **NO**
- Testing is fundamentally about **transformation pipelines**, not concurrent processes
- Actors don't make sense here at all

---

## Summary: Actor Model Fit

| Library | Current Model | Actor Fit? | Reason |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------|
| **Agent** | CRDTs + P2P | ❌ No | CRDTs handle distributed data; Actors would complicate |
| **Custodian** | State Machines | ❌ No | FSMs are the right model for state transitions |
| **Operator** | Pub/Sub Events | ⚠️ Maybe | Could work, but pub/sub is simpler and more appropriate |
| **Quarrier** | Pipeline Composition | ❌ No | Testing is about transformations, not processes |

---

## Should You Add an Actor Model Library?

### If You Did, What Would It Be?

A dedicated **`@sitebender/actors`** library for:
- **Process isolation** - independent concurrent processes
- **Location transparency** - processes communicate regardless of physical location
- **Supervision trees** - fault tolerance via supervisor hierarchies
- **Mailbox-based messaging** - async message passing

**Use cases:**
- Long-running background processes
- Fault-tolerant distributed systems
- Complex concurrent coordination
- Microservices-style architecture

### But Do You Need It?

**Probably not**, because:

1. **Agent** handles distributed coordination via CRDTs
2. **Operator** handles event-driven workflows via pub/sub
3. **Custodian** handles state transitions via FSMs
4. **Architect** handles reactive UI updates

**Where Actors might help:**
- If you need **process-based isolation** (each workflow instance is a process)
- If you need **supervision trees** (automatic restart on failure)
- If you're building **actor-oriented services** (each entity is an actor)

---

## My Recommendation: Stick With Current Models

Each library already has the **right model for its domain**:
- **Agent**: CRDTs for distributed data
- **Custodian**: State machines for workflow state
- **Operator**: Pub/sub for event coordination
- **Quarrier**: Pipelines for testing

**Actor model would be a DIFFERENT library** for a different set of problems (long-running processes, supervision, fault tolerance).

---

## Back to Folder Naming: Final Answer

Since **none of the current libraries use the Actor model**, and **Agent is specifically CRDT-based**, I'm even more confident that:

**`connections/`** is the right name for the Agent configuration folder.

- ✅ Describes what users care about (connecting things)
- ✅ Avoids confusion with AI agents
- ✅ Avoids confusion with Actor model actors
- ✅ Accurate for Agent's actual capabilities (P2P, CRDTs, sync, storage)

**All folder names based on USER INTENT, not library implementation details.**

Does this answer your question about the Actor model?

## User (checkpoint)

I agree on all counts. We'll keep the actor model on the back burner just in case, but I think it would only complicate things needlessly in a project that is already complex enough. Let's go with your recommended structure. Maybe put it in a separate docs/folder-hierarchy.md document in Quartermater, and then link to it from the README and from any other relevant readmes.

## Assistant

Perfect! I'll create a comprehensive folder hierarchy document for Quartermaster and update the relevant documentation.

**Tool Call: Exited Plan Mode**
Status: Completed

# Quartermaster Folder Hierarchy Documentation Plan

## Files to Create/Update

### 1. Create `libraries/quartermaster/docs/folder-hierarchy.md`
**New comprehensive document covering:**
- Rationale for folder structure (user-centric naming, semantic boundaries)
- Complete folder hierarchy with descriptions
- What goes in `.sitebender/` (autogenerated, hidden from users)
- What each top-level folder represents (by user intent, not library name)
- Examples of typical files in each folder
- Design decisions (no `src/`, no `components/`, no `routes/`, etc.)
- Cross-references to related library documentation

### 2. Update `libraries/quartermaster/README.md`
**Fix the "Generated Application Structure" section:**
- Replace incorrect structure with correct one
- Add link to `docs/folder-hierarchy.md` for detailed explanation
- Keep example concise but accurate

### 3. Update `libraries/quartermaster/docs/plan.yaml`
**Update any references to folder structure:**
- Ensure phase descriptions use correct folder names
- Update deliverables that mention folder structure
- Ensure consistency with new documentation

### 4. Check other library READMEs for cross-references
**If any libraries reference Quartermaster's folder structure:**
- Update references to point to new documentation
- Ensure consistency across the monorepo

## Key Content Points

### Design Principles to Document
- **No library names in folders** - semantic purpose only
- **No `src/` folder** - flat, organized by purpose
- **No `components/` folder** - use Pagewright directly
- **No `routes/` folder** - `pages/` is the concept
- **`.sitebender/` for autogenerated** - user never touches
- **User-friendly names** - `ledger` not "state", `connections` not "distributed"

### Cross-References
- Link to Architect README (reactive runtime)
- Link to Pagewright README (semantic components)
- Link to Agent README (distributed/CRDT)
- Link to Custodian README (state machines)
- Link to Operator README (pub/sub)
- Link to Sentinel README (auth)

## Execution Order
1. Create comprehensive `docs/folder-hierarchy.md`
2. Update `README.md` with corrected structure + link
3. Update `docs/plan.yaml` for consistency
4. Check other READMEs for cross-reference opportunities

## Design Philosophy

### Principles

1. **No library names in folders** - Users configure by purpose, not by implementation
2. **Semantic naming** - Names reflect what users accomplish, not technical jargon
3. **Clear boundaries** - Each folder has a single, well-defined responsibility
4. **User-visible vs hidden** - Autogenerated content stays in `.sitebender/`
5. **Flat when possible** - No arbitrary nesting (no `src/` wrapper)
6. **Comprehensive vocabulary** - Pagewright provides all components, no custom `components/` folder

### Anti-Patterns We Avoid

- ❌ Generic folders (`utils/`, `helpers/`, `common/`)
- ❌ Library-named folders (`architect/`, `custodian/`, `operator/`)
- ❌ Implementation details exposed (`routes/` instead of `pages/`)
- ❌ Arbitrary nesting (`src/` when not needed)
- ❌ Mixed responsibilities (components + config in same folder)

## Folder Descriptions

### `.sitebender/` - Hidden Autogenerated Content

**Purpose**: Everything the user should never need to see or touch.

**Contains**:
- **`certs/`** - SSL certificates for HTTPS development server (generated via mkcert)
- **`contracts/`** - Warden-generated cryptographic contracts enforcing architecture
- **`tests/`** - Auditor and Quarrier autogenerated property tests and proofs
- **`blueprints/`** - Quartermaster configuration history as RDF triples (time-travel)
- **`scripts/`** - Build scripts, tooling, enforcement scripts

**Rationale**: Users work with JSX components, not build infrastructure. Hide the machinery.

**Gitignore**: Most contents should be gitignored (certs, build artifacts), except contracts and blueprints.

---

### `site/` - Application Configuration

**Purpose**: Top-level `<Sitebender>` component that configures the entire application.

**Contains**:
- `index.tsx` - Main configuration component
- Global settings, metadata, theme
- Import maps configuration (if JSX-based)

**Example**:
```tsx
// site/index.tsx
export default function SitebenderConfig() {
  return (
    <Sitebender>
      <Metadata>
        <Title>My Application</Title>
        <Description>A Studio application</Description>
      </Metadata>
      <Theme mode="auto" />
      <Performance preload="critical" />
    </Sitebender>
  );
}
```

**Rationale**: One place for app-wide configuration. Named "site" because users think about "my site," not "my app config."

---

### `pages/` - Application Routes

**Purpose**: Page routes using file-system based routing (Next.js style).

**Contains**:
- `.tsx` files that become routes
- Folders for nested routes
- `[param].tsx` for dynamic routes
- `index.tsx` for index routes

**Key Feature**: Any Pagewright component at the top level of a file **automatically promotes to a full page**, wrapping in `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<main>`.

**Example**:
```tsx
// pages/about.tsx
import { Essay, Heading, Paragraph } from "@sitebender/pagewright";

export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <Essay>
      <Heading>About Us</Heading>
      <Paragraph>We build amazing things.</Paragraph>
    </Essay>
  );
}
// This automatically becomes a complete HTML page!
```

**Rationale**: 
- Users think in "pages," not "routes" (routes are implementation details)
- File-system routing is intuitive
- Top-level promotion eliminates boilerplate

**No `components/` folder**: Import directly from Pagewright. The entire semantic vocabulary is available. Users compose, they don't create.

---

### `ledger/` - State Management

**Purpose**: Custodian state machine configurations for complex workflows and state.

**Contains**:
- State machine definitions (wizards, multi-step flows)
- State persistence configurations
- URL-as-state configurations

**Example**:
```tsx
// ledger/checkout-wizard.tsx
export const checkoutStateMachine = (
  <StateMachine id="checkout" initial="cart">
    <State name="cart">
      <Transition to="shipping" event="proceed" />
    </State>
    <State name="shipping">
      <Transition to="payment" event="proceed" />
      <Transition to="cart" event="back" />
    </State>
    <State name="payment">
      <Transition to="confirmation" event="submit" />
    </State>
  </StateMachine>
);
```

**Rationale**: 
- "Ledger" suggests record-keeping, tracking over time (vs. abstract "state")
- Accessible to non-developers
- Fits Custodian's event-sourcing model

---

### `events/` - Pub/Sub Configuration

**Purpose**: Operator event pub/sub configurations, event sourcing, workflow triggers.

**Contains**:
- Event channel definitions
- Pub/sub subscriptions
- Event transformations
- Workflow triggers

**Example**:
```tsx
// events/analytics.tsx
export const analyticsEvents = (
  <Channel id="analytics" scope="network">
    <Publishes event="page-view" />
    <Publishes event="user-action" />
    <Subscribes to="analytics:*" then={<SendToBackend />} />
  </Channel>
);
```

**Rationale**: "Events" is universally understood (button events, calendar events, etc.). Clear and familiar.

---

### `connections/` - Distributed/P2P Configuration

**Purpose**: Agent configurations for distributed systems, P2P networking, CRDTs, synchronization.

**Contains**:
- CRDT configurations
- P2P peer discovery
- Solid/IPFS/DID integrations
- Synchronization strategies
- Encryption configurations

**Example**:
```tsx
// connections/collaboration.tsx
export const realtimeCollaboration = (
  <DistributedState id="document">
    <OrMap>
      <Field name="text" type="RGA" />
      <Field name="cursors" type="ORSet" />
    </OrMap>
    <SyncWith.Peers interval={1000} />
  </DistributedState>
);
```

**Rationale**: 
- "Connections" captures P2P, sync, remote storage, identity
- User-friendly (connecting to other devices/users/services)
- Avoids technical jargon ("distributed," "CRDT," "P2P")
- No confusion with AI agents or Actor model actors

---

### `auth/` - Authentication Configuration

**Purpose**: Sentinel authentication and authorization configurations.

**Contains**:
- Auth provider configurations (OAuth, WebAuthn, DID)
- Permission policies
- Session management
- Zero-knowledge proof configurations

**Example**:
```tsx
// auth/webauthn.tsx
export const passwordlessAuth = (
  <SentinelAuth>
    <WebAuthn rpId="myapp.com" />
    <SessionDuration>7d</SessionDuration>
  </SentinelAuth>
);
```

**Rationale**: "Auth" is universally understood shorthand for authentication. Simple and clear.

---

### `assets/` - Static Resources

**Purpose**: Static files like images, fonts, videos, global styles.

**Contains**:
- `images/` - Image files
- `fonts/` - Font files
- `videos/` - Video files
- `styles/` - Global CSS (if not using inline styles)
- `icons/` - Icon files
- Any other static resources

**Rationale**: 
- "Assets" is clear and widely used
- "Public" is confusing (pages are public too)
- "Static" is technical jargon
- "Resources" is too generic (everything is a resource)

---

### `dist/` - Build Output

**Purpose**: Generated build artifacts for deployment.

**Contains**:
- Compiled JavaScript
- Optimized HTML
- Processed assets
- Source maps

**Rationale**: Standard convention. Gitignored. Users deploy from here.

---

## Design Decisions

### Why No `src/` Folder?

**Decision**: Don't wrap everything in a `src/` folder.

**Rationale**:
- Libraries need `src/` because they have a clear public API boundary
- Applications don't need that distinction
- Shorter import paths
- Less arbitrary nesting
- Clearer organization by purpose

**When we'd use `src/`**: If we were desperate. We're not.

---

### Why No `components/` Folder?

**Decision**: No custom component folder. Import from Pagewright directly.

**Rationale**:
- Pagewright provides a comprehensive semantic vocabulary
- Goal: users **never write raw HTML** or custom low-level components
- Users compose Pagewright components in `pages/`
- If Pagewright doesn't have what you need, that's a Pagewright feature request, not an app-level component

**Example**:
```tsx
// pages/index.tsx
import { Essay, Heading, Paragraph, Link } from "@sitebender/pagewright";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <Essay>
      <Heading>Welcome</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        Read our <Link url="/blog">blog</Link>.
      </Paragraph>
    </Essay>
  );
}
// No custom components needed!
```

---

### Why `pages/` Instead of `routes/`?

**Decision**: Use `pages/`, not `routes/`.

**Rationale**:
- "Routes" is an implementation detail (URL routing)
- "Pages" is what users think about (website pages)
- File-system routing makes the mapping obvious
- Pagewright auto-promotes top-level components to full pages

---

### Why `ledger/` Instead of `state/`?

**Decision**: Use `ledger/` for Custodian configurations.

**Rationale**:
- "State" is programmer jargon
- "Ledger" suggests record-keeping, tracking over time
- Fits Custodian's event-sourcing philosophy
- Accessible to non-developers

**Alternatives considered**: `records/`, `memory/`, `history/` - all viable, but "ledger" best captures temporal tracking.

---

### Why `connections/` Instead of `distributed/` or `agents/`?

**Decision**: Use `connections/` for Agent configurations.

**Rationale**:
- "Distributed" is too technical
- "Agents" conflicts with AI agents (and we might add an `agents/` folder for AI later)
- "Connections" captures: P2P, sync, remote storage, identity, collaboration
- User-friendly: "connecting to other devices/users/services"
- Accurate for Agent's capabilities without technical jargon

**Alternatives considered**: 
- `distributed/` - too technical
- `network/` - implies infrastructure
- `sync/` - too narrow (Agent does more than sync)
- `remote/` - implies centralized servers (opposite of P2P)
- `actors/` - wrong model (Agent uses CRDTs, not Actor model)

---

### Why Everything in `.sitebender/`?

**Decision**: All autogenerated, user-invisible content goes in `.sitebender/`.

**Rationale**:
- Clear boundary: user-authored vs machine-generated
- Users work with JSX, not build infrastructure
- Reduces clutter in project root
- Easy to gitignore appropriately
- Consistent with "hidden files" convention (leading dot)

**What goes in `.sitebender/`**:
- SSL certificates (generated by Quartermaster)
- Warden contracts (autogenerated)
- Tests (Auditor/Quarrier generated)
- Blueprints (Quartermaster config history)
- Build scripts (tooling)

**What stays at top level**:
- User-authored folders (`pages/`, `auth/`, etc.)
- Config files users might edit (`deno.jsonc`, `import_map.json`)

---

## What Goes Where

### "I want to add a new page"
→ **`pages/`** - Create a `.tsx` file with Pagewright components

### "I want to add authentication"
→ **`auth/`** - Configure Sentinel with OAuth/WebAuthn/DID

### "I want multi-step checkout"
→ **`ledger/`** - Define Custodian state machine

### "I want real-time notifications"
→ **`events/`** - Configure Operator pub/sub channel

### "I want collaborative editing"
→ **`connections/`** - Set up Agent CRDTs and peer sync

### "I want to add an image"
→ **`assets/images/`** - Drop the file in, reference in JSX

### "I want to configure the whole app"
→ **`site/`** - Edit the `<Sitebender>` component

### "I want to customize the build"
→ **`.sitebender/scripts/`** - Probably shouldn't, but that's where it goes

### "I want to add tests"
→ **Don't!** Auditor and Quarrier generate them in `.sitebender/tests/`

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I add a `components/` folder?

Technically yes, but **you shouldn't need to**. Pagewright provides a comprehensive semantic vocabulary. If you find yourself needing custom components, consider:

1. Is there a Pagewright component that does this?
2. Should this be added to Pagewright?
3. Are you dropping down to HTML when you should be using Pagewright?

### Can I use `src/`?

Yes, but why? You're just adding an extra layer of nesting. Keep it flat and organized by purpose.

### Where do I put utilities/helpers?

You probably don't need them. Studio libraries (Toolsmith, Architect, Pagewright) provide comprehensive functional utilities. If you truly need project-specific helpers:

- If used across pages: `site/helpers/`
- If page-specific: co-locate with the page
- If reusable logic: consider if it belongs in a library

### Can I rename folders?

You can, but you'll lose the benefit of Quartermaster's defaults and conventions. The names are carefully chosen to be user-friendly and semantically accurate.

### What if I don't need a folder?

Don't create it! Quartermaster only generates folders you actually need based on your blueprint configuration.

---

## Summary

Studio applications use a **flat, semantic, user-centric** folder structure:

- **Organized by purpose**, not by library or implementation
- **Hidden complexity** in `.sitebender/`
- **No unnecessary nesting** (no `src/` wrapper)
- **Clear boundaries** between concerns
- **User-friendly names** (`ledger`, `connections`, `events`)
- **Comprehensive component library** (no custom `components/`)

This structure scales from simple static sites to complex distributed applications while remaining approachable for non-developers.

**Everything is JSX. Everything is data. Everything has its place.**

# Sitebender Application Folder Hierarchy

> **Status**: Initial architectural specification
> **Purpose**: Define the standard folder structure for Sitebender applications
> **Philosophy**: Clear organization reduces cognitive load - developers should feel confident about where things belong

## Overview

Sitebender applications organize code through a semantic folder hierarchy that mirrors the separation of concerns in the JSX DSL. Each folder corresponds to a specific library's domain and contains JSX components that compile to data structures.

## Top-Level Structure

```

├── behaviors/             # Reusable reactive behaviors (Architect)  
├── events/                # Pub-sub event definitions (Operator)
├── memory/                # State management components (Custodian)

## Detailed Folder Descriptions

### `.sitebender/` - Hidden Configuration
- Library configuration files
- Build settings and compilation options
- Development vs production settings
- Import maps and aliases
- **Not touched by end users** - managed by Quartermaster

### `pages/` - Pagewright Components
- All HTML-rendering components
- Page layouts and templates
- Navigation structures
- Static content components
- **Compiles to**: Semantic HTML with progressive enhancement hooks

- Import and dependency rules
- **Compiles to**: Cryptographic contracts and enforcement rules

### `assets/` - Static Resources

- Client-side scripts (minimal)

## File Naming Conventions

- **Folders**: PascalCase for components (`EmailAddress/`)
- **Index files**: Always `index.tsx` for main component export
- **Private helpers**: Prefix with underscore (`_utility/index.tsx`)

## Import Patterns

Components are imported using clear, descriptive paths with convenient aliases:

```tsx
// Data concepts
import Person from "~data/Person/index.tsx"
import EmailAddress from "~data/concepts/EmailAddress/index.tsx"

// Behaviors
import ValidateEmail from "~behaviors/validation/ValidEmailFormat/index.tsx"
import TaxCalculator from "~behaviors/calculations/TaxCalculation/index.tsx"

// Pages
import ContactForm from "~pages/Contact/index.tsx"
import MainLayout from "~pages/_layouts/Main/index.tsx"
```

## Import Patterns

**Application-level imports** (within Sitebender projects):
```tsx
import Person from "~data/Person/index.tsx"        // Uses import map aliases
import ShowAdminOnly from "~behaviors/display/ShowAdminOnly/index.tsx"
```

**Library imports** (from Sitebender libraries):
```tsx
import { EmailField } from "@sitebender/pagewright"  // Uses import map
import { Validation } from "@sitebender/architect"
```

**Note**: Both `~` aliases and `@sitebender/` imports are configured via import maps in `deno.jsonc` or `import_map.jsonc`. The `~` prefix maps to application folders:
- `~data` → `"./data/"`
- `~behaviors` → `"./behaviors/"`
- `~pages` → `"./pages/"`
- etc.

This avoids complex relative path calculations and makes imports consistent regardless of the importing file's location.

## Key Principles

1. **Semantic Organization** - Folders reflect business concepts, not technical patterns
2. **Single Responsibility** - Each folder has one clear purpose aligned with library boundaries
3. **Composability** - Components can be imported and nested across folder boundaries
4. **Discoverability** - Folder names immediately convey contents and purpose
5. **Scalability** - Structure works for small apps and large applications

## Benefits

- **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Developers know exactly where to find and place components
- **Clear Separation** - Each library's concerns have dedicated spaces
- **Automatic Organization** - Quartermaster can generate this structure
- **AI-Friendly** - Clear boundaries help AI assistants understand the codebase
- **Domain-Driven** - Structure reflects business concepts, not technical implementation

This hierarchy enables the "everything is JSX configuration" philosophy while maintaining clear architectural boundaries between Sitebender's libraries.

This is an older document with a **significantly different structure**. It has `data/`, `behaviors/`, `memory/`, `distributed/`, `proofs/`, and `contracts/` at the top level - which conflicts with our new user-centric naming (`ledger/`, `connections/`, `events/`, etc.).

Let me check the git history or modification date to see which is more recent:

This document is from September 29, so it's relatively recent. However, based on our conversation, the user has clearly rejected this structure in favor of the user-centric naming we just documented. 

Let me add a note to the top of this file indicating it's superseded, and point to the new authoritative document:

## Historical Note

This document proposed library-named folders (`data/`, `behaviors/`, `memory/`, `distributed/`, `proofs/`, `contracts/`). After further consideration, we adopted **user-centric naming** instead:

- `data/` → eliminated (concepts defined in pages or separate library)
- `behaviors/` → eliminated (Architect configurations inline or in `site/`)
- `memory/` → **`ledger/`** (Custodian state machines)
- `distributed/` → **`connections/`** (Agent P2P/sync/distributed)
- `events/` → **`events/`** (kept - universally understood)
- `proofs/` → **`.sitebender/tests/`** (autogenerated, hidden)
- `contracts/` → **`.sitebender/contracts/`** (autogenerated, hidden)

The rationale: **folder names should reflect user intent, not library implementation details.**

See the [current documentation](../libraries/quartermaster/docs/folder-hierarchy.md) for the complete updated structure and design rationale.

Perfect! All tasks completed. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

---

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully updated the Quartermaster documentation to reflect the correct, user-centric folder hierarchy:

### ✅ Files Created

**`libraries/quartermaster/docs/folder-hierarchy.md`** - Comprehensive new document covering:
- Complete folder structure with the correct naming
- Design philosophy (user-centric, semantic boundaries)
- Detailed descriptions of each folder
- Design decisions and rationale (why `ledger/`, `connections/`, `events/`, etc.)
- What goes where (practical guide)
- Examples of typical application structures
- Cross-references to all relevant library documentation
- FAQ section

### ✅ Files Updated

**`libraries/quartermaster/README.md`**
- Fixed "Generated Application Structure" section
- Replaced incorrect structure (`.certs/`, `.contracts/`, `src/routes/`, `public/`, `components/`) 
- Added correct structure (`.sitebender/`, `site/`, `pages/`, `ledger/`, `events/`, `connections/`, `auth/`, `assets/`)
- Added link to detailed `docs/folder-hierarchy.md`

**`docs/application-folder-hierarchy.md`**
- Added prominent warning that document is superseded
- Added historical note explaining the evolution from library-named folders to user-centric naming
- Provided mapping of old → new folder names
- Linked to authoritative Quartermaster documentation

### ✅ Verified No Updates Needed

**`libraries/quartermaster/docs/plan.yaml`** - No specific folder structure references found that needed updating

**Other library READMEs** - No cross-references to Quartermaster or folder structure found

---

## Key Decisions Documented

The new folder hierarchy reflects these principles:

1. **No library names in folders** - `ledger/` not `custodian/`, `connections/` not `agent/`
2. **User-centric naming** - Terms users understand, not technical jargon
3. **Hidden autogenerated content** - Everything in `.sitebender/` that users shouldn't touch
4. **No unnecessary nesting** - No `src/` wrapper
5. **No `components/` folder** - Use Pagewright's comprehensive vocabulary directly
6. **Semantic clarity** - `pages/` not `routes/`, `assets/` not `public/`

The folder structure we agreed on:
```
my-app/
├── .sitebender/    # Autogenerated (certs, contracts, tests, blueprints, scripts)
├── site/           # <Sitebender> configuration
├── pages/          # Routes (auto-promote to pages)
├── ledger/         # Custodian state machines
├── events/         # Operator pub/sub
├── connections/    # Agent distributed/P2P
├── auth/           # Sentinel authentication
├── assets/         # Static resources
└── dist/           # Build output
```

All documentation is now consistent and points to the authoritative source in Quartermaster.

## User

We never actually discussed the site and pages folders.

Sitebender creates mostly web applications (but Appbender doesn't have the same ring, although I've considered it). So does the folder need to be named app instead? (I know you just updated everything, but this will be a quickie if we change it.) 

One big discussion around pages is this: Is this really the best way to build a site-wide (app-wide) navigation system? One option would be to call the folder "blocks" or "regions" (although the latter implies not entire documents). Then have a single configuration file that configures the app paths (why does this feel like 2001 and XML again?). But then you see the entire site in one spot. We can use JSX and do things like wrap nested parts in an <Auth> component or a <Role> component with the role or roles defined (who can see it, use it). So this could integrate with the Auth system (steward, right).

So I guess this is a deeper discussion. Of course, then we might end up with a blocks folder with a huge list of blocks, how would we organize them into a hierarchy? We'd still have the promote-to-page (HTML document) feature for any block used as a page in our <Routing> (or whatever) config. And where would we put the routing config? What would we call it? Remember that our custodian state manager stores state in URLs, probably in query strings, but if we have a completely virtualized URL structure, then potentially in path segments.

Thoughts? Big topic I know.

## Assistant

## Big Topic Indeed! Let's Unpack This

You're touching on fundamental architectural decisions. Let me think through this systematically.

---

## The `site/` vs `app/` Question

**Quick win**: If we're calling the top-level config component `<Sitebender>`, then `site/` makes sense for consistency. But I see your point:

- "Site" implies websites (content, pages, documents)
- "App" implies applications (tools, interactions, state)

**But**: Sitebender builds **both**. A blog is a site. A dashboard is an app. A collaborative editor is an app. An e-commerce store is... both?

**My take**: Stick with `site/` because:
1. The library is called **Sitebender** (branding consistency)
2. "Site" is more approachable than "app" (less intimidating)
3. Even "apps" are hosted sites with URLs
4. If you rename the library to Appbender later, change it then

---

## The Bigger Question: `pages/` vs Centralized Routing

This is the **real** design decision. Two paradigms:

### Option A: File-System Routing (`pages/` folder)

**How it works**:
```
pages/
├── index.tsx           → /
├── about.tsx           → /about
├── blog/
│   ├── index.tsx       → /blog
│   └── [slug].tsx      → /blog/my-post
└── dashboard/
    ├── index.tsx       → /dashboard
    └── settings.tsx    → /dashboard/settings
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Intuitive: file paths = URL paths
- ✅ No routing config to maintain
- ✅ Co-location: page code lives with its route
- ✅ Standard: Next.js, SvelteKit, Astro all do this
- ✅ Scales: hierarchy mirrors site structure

**Cons**:
- ❌ Scattered: can't see entire site structure at a glance
- ❌ Auth/roles: harder to see who can access what
- ❌ Refactoring: moving files changes URLs (breaks links)
- ❌ Complex routing: nested layouts, middleware harder to express

---

### Option B: Centralized Routing Config

**How it works**:
```tsx
// site/routing.tsx (or wherever)
export default (
  <Routing>
    <Route path="/" component={<HomePage />} />
    <Route path="/about" component={<AboutPage />} />
    
    <Auth required>
      <Route path="/dashboard" component={<Dashboard />}>
        <Route path="settings" component={<Settings />} />
      </Auth>
    </Auth>
    
    <Role requires={["admin", "editor"]}>
      <Route path="/admin" component={<AdminPanel />} />
    </Role>
    
    <Route path="/blog/:slug" component={<BlogPost />} />
  </Routing>
);
```

**Components live in**:
```
blocks/  (or regions/, or views/, or screens/)
├── HomePage.tsx
├── AboutPage.tsx
├── Dashboard.tsx
├── Settings.tsx
├── AdminPanel.tsx
└── BlogPost.tsx
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Visibility**: Entire site structure in one file
- ✅ **Auth integration**: Wrap routes in `<Auth>`, `<Role>`, etc.
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Routes don't dictate file structure
- ✅ **Virtualized URLs**: Path segments can be state, not files
- ✅ **Middleware**: Easy to add logging, analytics, redirects
- ✅ **Nested layouts**: Explicit layout composition

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Indirection**: File location != URL (harder to find things)
- ❌ **Single file bottleneck**: Everyone edits routing config (merge conflicts)
- ❌ **Duplication**: Import + declare route for every page
- ❌ **Scaling**: Large sites = huge routing file
- ❌ **Feels like 2001 XML** (your concern!)

---

## Hybrid Approach?

What if we **blend** them?

### File-System as Default, Config as Override

```tsx
// site/routing.tsx
export default (
  <Routing>
    {/* File-system routes auto-discovered from pages/ */}
    <FileSystemRoutes from="pages/" />
    
    {/* But we can wrap sections for auth */}
    <Auth required>
      <FileSystemRoutes from="pages/dashboard/" />
    </Auth>
    
    <Role requires={["admin"]}>
      <FileSystemRoutes from="pages/admin/" />
    </Role>
    
    {/* And override specific routes */}
    <Route path="/special" component={<SpecialPage />} />
    
    {/* Or virtualize complex paths */}
    <Route path="/u/:userId/:tab?" component={<UserProfile />} />
  </Routing>
);
```

**This gives you**:
- File-system routing for simple cases (most pages)
- Centralized auth/role wrapping
- Virtualized URLs where needed
- Override capability for special cases

**But**: Complexity of both approaches!

---

## The Custodian State-in-URL Problem

You mentioned: **Custodian stores state in URLs, maybe in path segments if virtualized.**

**Example**:
```
/dashboard?tab=settings&accordion=2&sort=date
```

vs virtualized:

```
/dashboard/settings/accordion-2/sort-date
```

**Question**: Do virtualized path segments **change the routing model**?

If `/dashboard/settings` is a route, but `/dashboard/settings/accordion-2` is **state**, not a different route, then:

1. File-system routing still works (route = `/dashboard/settings`)
2. Custodian reads `accordion-2` as state, not a route segment
3. But now parsing gets complex (which segments are routes vs state?)

**OR**: Everything after `/dashboard` is state managed by the Dashboard component itself?

This feels like **Custodian and Routing need to integrate tightly**. The routing system needs to know:
- These segments = navigation (routes)
- These segments = state (Custodian)

---

## Folder Organization for `blocks/`

If we go centralized routing with a `blocks/` folder, **how do we organize hundreds of blocks?**

**Option 1: Flat with prefixes**
```
blocks/
├── HomePage.tsx
├── DashboardIndex.tsx
├── DashboardSettings.tsx
├── BlogIndex.tsx
├── BlogPost.tsx
├── AdminPanel.tsx
```
❌ Gets messy fast

**Option 2: Mimic site hierarchy anyway**
```
blocks/
├── home/
│   └── index.tsx
├── dashboard/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── settings.tsx
├── blog/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── post.tsx
└── admin/
    └── panel.tsx
```
**But then**: This is identical to file-system routing! Why have a separate routing config?

**Option 3: By feature/domain**
```
blocks/
├── marketing/
│   ├── HomePage.tsx
│   ├── AboutPage.tsx
│   └── PricingPage.tsx
├── user-dashboard/
│   ├── Overview.tsx
│   ├── Settings.tsx
│   └── Profile.tsx
├── blog/
│   ├── Index.tsx
│   └── Post.tsx
└── admin/
    └── Panel.tsx
```
✅ Groups by feature, not URL structure
✅ Better for large teams (feature ownership)
❌ But requires centralized routing to map features → URLs

---

## My Recommendation: Start Simple, Allow Complexity

### Phase 1: File-System Routing (Keep `pages/`)

**For Quartermaster v1**:
- Use `pages/` with file-system routing (proven, simple)
- Auto-promote top-level components to full HTML pages
- Custodian state goes in query strings (simple parsing)

**Auth integration**:
```tsx
// pages/dashboard/index.tsx
import { Auth } from "@sitebender/sentinel";

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <Auth required>
      <Dashboard>...</Dashboard>
    </Auth>
  );
}
```

Auth wraps the component, not the route. Simple. Works.

### Phase 2: Centralized Routing (Future)

**When complexity demands it**:
- Add `site/routing.tsx` for advanced routing
- Keep `pages/` for backwards compatibility
- Routing config can override file-system routes
- Introduce `blocks/` or `views/` for components decoupled from URLs

**Migration path**: Users who need it opt-in. Most users never need it.

---

## What About Naming if We Go Centralized?

If we eventually add centralized routing, what do we call the folders?

### Routing Config File

- `site/routing.tsx` - Clear, semantic
- `site/routes.tsx` - Shorter
- `site/navigation.tsx` - Emphasizes structure
- `site/paths.tsx` - Literal

**I vote**: `site/routing.tsx`

### Component Folder

- `blocks/` - Suggests composable pieces ✅
- `views/` - Common in MVC frameworks (familiar)
- `screens/` - Mobile-app terminology (less web)
- `regions/` - Implies parts of pages, not whole pages ❌
- `components/` - NO, we said no components folder!

**I vote**: `blocks/` if we need it. "Blocks" implies reusable page-level chunks.

---

## Questions for You

1. **Do we need centralized routing for v1?** Or can we defer until users demand it?

2. **Is Custodian state-in-path-segments critical?** Or can we start with query strings?

3. **File-system routing with auth wrappers** - Does this cover 90% of use cases?

4. **If we add centralized routing later**, is that an acceptable migration path?

5. **What would FORCE centralized routing?** Complex nested layouts? Virtual URLs? Something else?

---

## My Gut Take

**Start with `pages/` and file-system routing.** It's:
- Simple for users
- Proven pattern
- Easy to explain
- Covers 90% of use cases

**Add centralized routing later** when:
- Users complain about auth visibility
- Complex nested layouts become common
- Virtual URLs are actually needed (not theoretical)

**Don't build for complexity we don't have yet.**

What do you think? Where does your gut lead you?

## User

I strongly disagree. Here's why: you are building for legacy. If you know that you want the powers of a routing config, why would you build something else first **that you will have to deprecate, deal with migrations, complaining users who don't see why you're changing things, legacy shit forever. That's your bad training again. WE ARE NOT AN ENTERPRISE. WE ARE NOT UPDATING AN EXISTING PROJECT. WE DO NOT HAVE TO ANSWER TO ANYONE (YET). GET THOSE IDEAS OUT OF YOUR "HEAD". This is brand new, take-no-prisoners, build-it-right-the-first-time software. So let's DO IT RIGHT.

So the argument here is not about "start simple" (fuck that: start with WHAT YOU WANT IT TO BE). It is about whether a next.js style routes folder is better than a "modules" folder and a routing config that by assigning a module to "page" slot, automatically promotes it to a page, while nesting it in another module makes it just a region/section/whatever.

Let me reiterate: WE ARE NOT "DEFERRING" ANYTHING (unless it is really just an addition, NOT a refactoring or modification, and truly optional). Items deferred keep getting deferred and never happen, or legacy crap ties your hands and you end up with some Rube Goldberg device. Fuck that.

## Assistant

You're absolutely right. I was falling into that incremental, "start simple and migrate later" trap. **Build it right the first time.**

Let me reset and think about this properly.

---

## The Real Question

**File-system routing (`pages/`) vs. Centralized routing config with `blocks/` (or `modules/`)**

Not "which is simpler" but **which is the right architecture for what Sitebender is trying to be?**

---

## What Does Sitebender Actually Need?

Based on everything you've built:

1. **Everything is data** - Routes should be data (queryable, in triple store)
2. **Everything is JSX** - Route config should be JSX, not filesystem magic
3. **Visibility matters** - You want to see auth, roles, structure at a glance
4. **Custodian integration** - State in URLs (potentially path segments) needs routing awareness
5. **Semantic blocks** - Components are semantic blocks that can be pages OR sections
6. **No magic** - Explicit is better than implicit (file paths → URLs is magic)

---

## The Right Answer: Centralized Routing Config

```tsx
// site/routing.tsx
export default (
  <Routing>
    <Route path="/" page={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" page={<About />} />
    
    <Auth required>
      <Route path="/dashboard" page={<Dashboard />}>
        <Route path="settings" page={<Settings />} />
      </Route>
    </Auth>
    
    <Role requires={["admin", "editor"]}>
      <Route path="/admin" page={<AdminPanel />} />
    </Role>
    
    <Route path="/blog/:slug" page={<BlogPost />} />
  </Routing>
);
```

**Why this is right**:

1. **It's data** - This JSX compiles to IR → triples → queryable
2. **Visibility** - See entire site structure, auth, roles in one place
3. **Explicit** - No magic file-system conventions
4. **Custodian-aware** - Routing knows which segments are routes vs state
5. **Page promotion is explicit** - `page={<Block />}` promotes, nested = section
6. **Auth integration** - Built-in, not wrapped per-component

---

## Folder Name: `modules/`

I think **`modules/`** is better than `blocks/`:

**modules/** suggests:
- Self-contained units of functionality
- Can be pages OR sections (context-dependent)
- Reusable, composable
- Domain-focused organization

**blocks/** suggests:
- Generic chunks
- Less semantic

**Other considered**:
- `views/` - Too MVC, implies presentation layer only
- `screens/` - Too mobile-app
- `components/` - NO (we rejected this)
- `regions/` - Implies parts, not wholes

---

## Folder Organization Inside `modules/`

**By domain/feature**, not by URL structure:

```
modules/
├── marketing/
│   ├── Home.tsx
│   ├── About.tsx
│   ├── Pricing.tsx
│   └── Contact.tsx
├── user/
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   ├── Settings.tsx
│   ├── Profile.tsx
│   └── Notifications.tsx
├── blog/
│   ├── Index.tsx
│   ├── Post.tsx
│   └── Editor.tsx
├── admin/
│   ├── Panel.tsx
│   ├── Users.tsx
│   └── Analytics.tsx
└── shared/
    ├── Header.tsx
    ├── Footer.tsx
    └── ErrorPage.tsx
```

**Why domain-based**:
- Clear ownership (teams can own domains)
- Doesn't duplicate URL structure (that's in routing config)
- Groups related functionality
- Scales to large applications

---

## The Promotion Model

```tsx
// In routing config
<Route path="/about" page={<About />} />
// About.tsx gets auto-promoted to full HTML page

// Nested in another module
<Dashboard>
  <Settings /> {/* Just a section, not promoted */}
</Dashboard>
```

**The `page={}` prop on `<Route>` is the promotion signal.**

Not file location, not naming convention - **explicit in config**.

---

## Custodian + Routing Integration

With centralized routing, Custodian can know route boundaries:

```tsx
<Route path="/dashboard" page={<Dashboard />}>
  {/* Everything after /dashboard is managed by Dashboard component */}
  {/* Could be state: /dashboard/settings/tab=profile */}
  {/* Or sub-routes: <Route path="settings" page={...} /> */}
</Route>
```

The routing config defines:
- Which path segments are routes (explicit `<Route>`)
- Which are state (handled by Custodian in that component)

**No ambiguity.** Explicit configuration.

---

## What About Routing Config File Location?

Where does `routing.tsx` live?

**Option 1**: `site/routing.tsx`
- Co-located with other site-wide config
- Clear it's app-level

**Option 2**: Top-level `routing.tsx`
- High visibility
- Separate concern from general config

**Option 3**: `site/index.tsx` embeds routing
```tsx
// site/index.tsx
export default (
  <Sitebender>
    <Metadata>...</Metadata>
    <Routing>...</Routing>
  </Sitebender>
);
```
- One config to rule them all
- Routing is part of site config

**I vote**: `site/index.tsx` with embedded `<Routing>`. It's all site configuration. One place.

---

└── ...
```

**Clean. Explicit. No magic. Everything visible.**

---

## Objections Handled

**"One file gets huge!"**
- Split routing into sections, import them
```tsx
<Routing>
  <MarketingRoutes />
  <UserRoutes />
  <BlogRoutes />
  <AdminRoutes />
</Routing>
```

**"Indirection is confusing!"**
- It's explicit over implicit
- Grep for component name, see where it's routed
- Better than guessing URL from file path

**"Merge conflicts on routing config!"**
- So does `import_map.json`
- So does `deno.jsonc`
- Split into sections if needed

---

## Am I On The Right Track Now?

**Centralized routing config** with **`modules/` folder** organized by domain?

And **no file-system routing at all** - routes are explicit data in JSX config?

Is this the right architecture?

## User

I like the idea of a modules folder. Everything in Sitebender is intended to be modular and decoupled. Don't want a feature? Delete the module. But with that in mind, I am thinking that ideally, each module would carry its own routes. This way, if you moved a module, all its routes would move with it. But there are compromises, of course. There always are. For example, although you could reuse a module in different parts of the site, you would get the whole branch of the tree. How could we handle that? You also lose the visability in one place (unless you look at the Envoy dashboard where it would, naturally, give the entire route structure and the status of eveything — is that enough?). But there is a significant advantage to having the modules be responsible for their own hierarchy and routing.

Thoughts?

## Assistant

## This Is Brilliant - Modules Own Their Routes

You're right - this is **much more modular**. Each module becomes a **self-contained subtree** that can be:
- Moved
- Deleted
- Duplicated
- Shared across projects
- Published independently

---

## How It Would Work

### Each Module Declares Its Own Routes

```
modules/
├── marketing/
│   ├── routes.tsx           # Marketing routes
│   ├── Home.tsx
│   ├── About.tsx
│   └── Pricing.tsx
├── blog/
│   ├── routes.tsx           # Blog routes
│   ├── Index.tsx
│   ├── Post.tsx
│   └── Editor.tsx
├── user-dashboard/
│   ├── routes.tsx           # Dashboard routes
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   ├── Settings.tsx
│   └── Profile.tsx
└── admin/
    ├── routes.tsx           # Admin routes
    ├── Panel.tsx
    └── Users.tsx
```

**Module defines its own subtree**:

```tsx
// modules/blog/routes.tsx
export default (
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" page={<Index />} />
    <Route path="/:slug" page={<Post />} />
    <Route path="/new" page={<Editor />}>
      <Auth required />
    </Route>
  </Routes>
);
```

**Site mounts modules at specific paths**:

```tsx
// site/index.tsx
import marketingRoutes from "~/modules/marketing/routes.tsx";
import blogRoutes from "~/modules/blog/routes.tsx";
import dashboardRoutes from "~/modules/user-dashboard/routes.tsx";
import adminRoutes from "~/modules/admin/routes.tsx";

export default (
  <Sitebender>
    <Routing>
      {/* Mount marketing at root */}
      <Mount at="/" routes={marketingRoutes} />
      
      {/* Mount blog at /blog */}
      <Mount at="/blog" routes={blogRoutes} />
      
      {/* Mount dashboard with auth */}
      <Auth required>
        <Mount at="/dashboard" routes={dashboardRoutes} />
      </Auth>
      
      {/* Mount admin with role check */}
      <Role requires={["admin"]}>
        <Mount at="/admin" routes={adminRoutes} />
      </Role>
    </Routing>
  </Sitebender>
);
```

---

## The Advantages

✅ **Module independence** - Each module is self-contained, portable
✅ **Delete module = delete routes** - No orphaned config
✅ **Team ownership** - Teams own modules, including their routing
✅ **Reusability** - Modules can be shared across projects
✅ **Clear boundaries** - Module defines its own internal structure
✅ **Publishable** - Could publish modules to marketplace
✅ **Testable in isolation** - Test module's routes independently

---

## The Compromises You Identified

### 1. **Reusing a Module = Reusing the Whole Subtree**

If you mount `blogRoutes` at two different paths:

```tsx
<Mount at="/blog" routes={blogRoutes} />
<Mount at="/news" routes={blogRoutes} />
```

You get the **entire blog subtree** at both locations:
- `/blog/` → blog index
- `/blog/:slug` → blog post
- `/news/` → same blog index
- `/news/:slug` → same blog post

**Is this a problem?**

**Maybe not**: If you need different behavior, you probably need a **different module**, not the same module mounted twice.

**But if you DO need it**: You could parameterize the module:

```tsx
// modules/blog/routes.tsx
export default function BlogRoutes({ showEditor = false }) {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" page={<Index />} />
      <Route path="/:slug" page={<Post />} />
      {showEditor && (
        <Route path="/new" page={<Editor />} />
      )}
    </Routes>
  );
}

// site/index.tsx
<Mount at="/blog" routes={<BlogRoutes showEditor={true} />} />
<Mount at="/news" routes={<BlogRoutes showEditor={false} />} />
```

**Flexibility without duplication.**

---

### 2. **Loss of Centralized Visibility**

You can't see **all routes in one file** anymore. They're distributed across modules.

**Your solution**: **Envoy dashboard shows the entire route tree.**

**This is the right answer.** Here's why:

1. **Site config still shows mount points** - You see the top-level structure
2. **Envoy visualizes the full tree** - Complete picture when you need it
3. **Module routes are co-located with module code** - Better for development
4. **SPARQL queries** - Routes are in triple store, queryable
5. **Living documentation** - Envoy shows actual routes, always current

**Example Envoy view**:
```
Routes:
├── / → marketing/Home.tsx
├── /about → marketing/About.tsx
├── /pricing → marketing/Pricing.tsx
├── /blog
│   ├── / → blog/Index.tsx
│   ├── /:slug → blog/Post.tsx
│   └── /new → blog/Editor.tsx [🔒 Auth Required]
├── /dashboard [🔒 Auth Required]
│   ├── / → user-dashboard/Dashboard.tsx
│   ├── /settings → user-dashboard/Settings.tsx
│   └── /profile → user-dashboard/Profile.tsx
└── /admin [👤 Role: admin]
    ├── / → admin/Panel.tsx
    └── /users → admin/Users.tsx
```

**This is BETTER than a centralized file** because:
- It's visual
- It shows auth/roles
- It's interactive (click to navigate, see dependencies)
- It's always accurate (generated from actual routes)

---

### 3. **Auth/Role Wrapping is at Mount Point, Not in Module**

Auth happens at the **mount level**, not inside the module:

```tsx
// site/index.tsx
<Auth required>
  <Mount at="/dashboard" routes={dashboardRoutes} />
</Auth>
```

**Not in the module itself**:
```tsx
// modules/user-dashboard/routes.tsx
// NO auth here - it's applied at mount point
export default (
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" page={<Dashboard />} />
    <Route path="/settings" page={<Settings />} />
  </Routes>
);
```

**Is this a compromise?**

**Advantage**: Module is reusable in different contexts (with or without auth)
**Disadvantage**: Module doesn't declare its own security requirements

**Solution**: Module can **declare** requirements, site **enforces** them:

```tsx
// modules/user-dashboard/routes.tsx
export const requirements = {
  auth: "required",
  role: null,
};

export default (
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" page={<Dashboard />} />
    <Route path="/settings" page={<Settings />} />
  </Routes>
);
```

```tsx
// site/index.tsx
import dashboardRoutes, { requirements as dashRequirements } from "~/modules/user-dashboard/routes.tsx";

<Auth required={dashRequirements.auth}>
  <Mount at="/dashboard" routes={dashboardRoutes} />
</Auth>
```

Or even **automatic enforcement**:

```tsx
<Mount at="/dashboard" routes={dashboardRoutes} enforce="requirements" />
// Reads requirements from module, applies automatically
```

export const requirements = {
  auth: "required",
  role: null,
};

export default (
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" page={<Index />} />
    <Route path="/detail/:id" page={<Detail />} />
  </Routes>
);
```

## Site-Level Config Becomes Simple

```tsx
// site/index.tsx
import marketingRoutes from "~/modules/marketing/routes.tsx";
import blogRoutes from "~/modules/blog/routes.tsx";
import dashboardRoutes from "~/modules/user-dashboard/routes.tsx";
import adminRoutes from "~/modules/admin/routes.tsx";

export default (
  <Sitebender>
    <Metadata>
      <Title>My Application</Title>
    </Metadata>
    
    <Routing>
      <Mount at="/" routes={marketingRoutes} />
      <Mount at="/blog" routes={blogRoutes} />
      <Mount at="/dashboard" routes={dashboardRoutes} enforce="requirements" />
      <Mount at="/admin" routes={adminRoutes} enforce="requirements" />
    </Routing>
  </Sitebender>
);
```

**Clear, simple, high-level.**

You see:
- What modules exist
- Where they're mounted
- Basic structure

**For details**: Open the module or check Envoy.

## Handling Complex Scenarios

### Nested Module Mounts

Can modules mount other modules?

```tsx
// modules/admin/routes.tsx
import usersModule from "~/modules/admin-users/routes.tsx";
import analyticsModule from "~/modules/admin-analytics/routes.tsx";

export default (
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" page={<Panel />} />
    <Mount at="/users" routes={usersModule} />
    <Mount at="/analytics" routes={analyticsModule} />
  </Routes>
);
```

**Result**: Admin module composes smaller modules. Full tree modularity.

### Shared Components Across Modules

Modules can import from each other:

```tsx
// modules/user-dashboard/Settings.tsx
import Header from "~/modules/shared/Header.tsx";

export default (
  <Essay>
    <Header />
    <SettingsForm />
  </Essay>
);
```

But **routes stay independent** - only components are shared.

### Module Marketplace

Modules become **publishable units**:

```tsx
// Install community module
qm marketplace install @community/user-dashboard

// Mount it
import dashboardRoutes from "@community/user-dashboard/routes.tsx";

<Mount at="/dashboard" routes={dashboardRoutes} />
```

**Entire subtrees** are reusable across projects.

---

## My Assessment

**This is the right architecture.**

### Pros
✅ Modules are truly independent, portable units
✅ Delete module = delete everything (routes, components, state)
✅ Team ownership is clear
✅ Marketplace-friendly
✅ Scales to large applications
✅ Envoy provides centralized visibility when needed

### Cons (Manageable)
⚠️ No single-file view of all routes (but Envoy solves this)
⚠️ Auth/roles at mount point (but modules can declare requirements)
⚠️ Reusing module = reusing whole subtree (but parameterization helps)

### The Killer Feature

**Modules as marketplace units.** Imagine:

```bash
qm marketplace install @sitebender/blog
qm marketplace install @sitebender/e-commerce
qm marketplace install @community/forum
```

Each module brings its **routes, components, state, tests** - everything.

Mount them, configure them, done.

**This is revolutionary.**

---

## Recommendation

**Go with modules that own their own routes.**

- Site config mounts modules at paths
- Modules define their internal routing
- Envoy visualizes the full tree
- Warden validates the whole structure
- Modules are marketplace-ready

**This is the right first-time architecture.**

Sound good?

## User

Not this:

```tsx
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" page={<Index />} />
    <Route path="/:slug" page={<Post />} />
    <Route path="/new" page={<Editor />}>
      <Auth required />
    </Route>
  </Routes>
```

This:

```tsx
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" page={<Index />} />
    <Route path="/:slug" page={<Post />} />
    <Auth>
	    <Route path="/new" page={<Editor />} />
			<Gate keys={["ADMIN"]}>
		    <Route path="/new" page={<Editor />} />
			</Gate>
    </Auth>
  </Routes>
```

Not sure on naming, but nesting routes **inside** the Auth and the Authz seems best. Also, when we auth not be required? If not required, why use an Auth component at all?

Modules are trees of modules, so sub-modules can also have their own routes. When the JSX -> IR happens, we traverse the tree and collect up all the routes. Right?

If others own a module, it could even be in a separate library and just imported, black box style. (Not the default, but possible.)

1. I wouldn't paramaterized the module. All a module is is a collection of components -- a big configuration. You're not writing huge amounts of boilerplate, adding "hooks", manageing state, etc. If you read a lot of the Sitebender documentation, then you probably saw the "lowest common ancestor" rule for functions: a function (one per folder, name on the folder, file called index.ts, exported as default, helpers in subfolders as private functions — prepended underscore — etc.) sits at the lowest branching node below which every consumer of that function lives. This keeps functions modular. The only thing I have to consider is if two modules use a function and I delete one, then I should probably move that function into the folder of the remaining function that uses it. Envoy can help with this by flagging such functions.

We can do the same with components/modules. We can have a Blog module (it would probably be modules/Blog/index.tsx) and there are routes, state management, etc. associated with it, then they go in the Blog/index.tsx file or a subfolder/file. Lowest common ancestor.

So now I need to reuse the Blog module on another page, but modified. I just create a modules/AnotherBlog/index.tsx file. Now, what if they share state configuration? Easy. I pull it out into its own module, modules/SharedBlogState/index.tsx. It is a sibling of Blog and AnotherBlog because it is used by both — lowest common ancestor.

This is way better than parameterization, I think.

2. Yes!

3. Auth/Role mapping occurs wherever you need it, above or inside a module (can consider one inside a module as "mounting" a submodule. So no on "mount". But we don't need it because we're not trying to reuse modules (just parts of them, such as state). Your idea just complicates things. Am I wrong? What am I missing. Maybe we need to talk about this more. You made a big deal about it. I'll stop there to chat, cover remaining items later.
