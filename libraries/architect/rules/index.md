1. **Key**: progressive-enhancement

**Title**: Thou shalt generate HTML that works without client-side JavaScript

**Details**:

- Components must output semantic HTML
- Generated forms must use standard HTML form elements
- Output must include server-side functionality patterns
- No client-side-JavaScript-only components

2. **Key**: respect-accessibility

**Title**: Thou shalt respect accessibility

**Details**:

- WCAG 2.3 AAA or better

## Progressive enhancement

**Component requirements**:

- Components must compile to HTML that works without client-side JS
- Generated HTML must support standard form submissions
- Output validation patterns that work server-side
- Compile to semantic HTML with proper ARIA attributes
- Interactive components must generate keyboard-navigable HTML
- Client-side JavaScript enhances the generated HTML, never replaces it

## Responsive design

**Requirements**:

- Components must be responsive by default
- Use relative units (rem, em, %, vw/vh) not fixed pixels for layout
- Provide responsive prop options for different breakpoints
- Support fluid typography that scales with viewport
- Grid and flex layouts that reflow naturally
- Never assume a fixed screen size
