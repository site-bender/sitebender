/**
 * Generates a loan amortization schedule
 *
 * Creates a detailed payment schedule showing how each payment is split
 * between principal and interest over the life of a loan. Each entry
 * includes the payment number, payment amount, interest portion, principal
 * portion, and remaining balance. The schedule demonstrates how early
 * payments are mostly interest while later payments are mostly principal.
 *
 * @param principal - Initial loan amount
 * @param rate - Interest rate per period (as decimal)
 * @param periods - Number of payment periods
 * @returns Array of amortization entries, or empty array if invalid
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Simple loan: $1000 at 1% monthly for 3 months
 * amortizationSchedule(1000)(0.01)(3)
 * // Returns 3 payment entries with decreasing interest
 *
 * // No interest loan
 * amortizationSchedule(1200)(0)(4)
 * // 4 equal payments of $300 principal
 *
 * // View total interest paid
 * const schedule = amortizationSchedule(50000)(0.06/12)(60)
 * const totalInterest = schedule.reduce(
 *   (sum, entry) => sum + entry.interest, 0
 * )
 *
 * // Partial application
 * const fiveYearLoan = (amount: number) =>
 *   amortizationSchedule(amount)(0.07/12)(60)
 * fiveYearLoan(10000)  // Small loan
 * fiveYearLoan(50000)  // Large loan
 *
 * // Invalid inputs
 * amortizationSchedule(null)(0.05)(12)  // []
 * amortizationSchedule(10000)(0.05)(0)  // []
 * ```
 * @pure
 * @curried
 * @safe - Returns empty array for invalid inputs
