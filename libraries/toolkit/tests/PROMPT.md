# Testing Implementation Session Context for @sitebender/toolkit

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SCOPE RESTRICTION ⚠️

**THIS AI INSTANCE WORKS EXCLUSIVELY IN `/libraries/toolkit/`**

- DO NOT touch ANYTHING in `/libraries/adaptive/` - another AI is working there
- DO NOT touch ANYTHING in `/libraries/components/` - outside scope
- DO NOT modify ANY files outside `/libraries/toolkit/`
- ALL work, including tests and source fixes, must be within `/libraries/toolkit/`
- Git commits should ONLY include files from `/libraries/toolkit/`

## Overview

This document provides context for continuing the comprehensive testing implementation for the @sitebender/toolkit library. The library is a pure functional programming utility library with zero dependencies, consisting of mathematical functions, array/string operations, monadic types (Either, Maybe, Result), and IO operations.

## Current Testing Status (Updated: 2025-08-25)

**Overall Progress: 13.8% tested (118/854 functions with 100% coverage)**

### Latest Session Achievements (2025-08-25 - Session 11)

- Added comprehensive tests for 7 array functions with 100% coverage:
  - `isEmpty` - Checks if array is empty
  - `compact` - Removes undefined values from array (preserves other falsy values)
  - `aperture` - Creates sliding window of consecutive n-tuples
  - `cartesianProduct` - Returns all possible pairs from two arrays
  - `xprod` - Alias for cartesianProduct
  - `closest` - Finds value closest to target number
  - `combinations` - Generates all k-element combinations
- Fixed type errors in test files for proper TypeScript compliance
- Fixed edge case tests based on actual function behavior
- All tests passing with type checking enabled
- 100% code coverage for all tested functions
- Zero linting errors

### Previous Session Achievements (2025-08-25 - Session 10)

- **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed all TypeScript type errors in test files
  - Added explicit type parameters to generic curried functions (`replaceAt<T>`, `update<T>`, etc.)
  - Tests now pass WITH type checking - no `--no-check` flag needed
  - Maintained 100% coverage for all tested functions
- **ADDITIONAL FIX**: Fixed NaN comparison issues in `head`, `last`, and `nth` tests
  - Changed from `===` to `Object.is()` for proper NaN, -0/+0 comparison
  - Ensures tests correctly verify consistency with native `array.at()` method
- All tests passing with proper type safety and edge case handling

### Previous Session Achievements (2025-08-25 - Session 9)

### Earlier Session Achievements (2025-08-24 - Session 4)

- Added comprehensive tests for 6 array predicate and search functions with 100% coverage: all, some, none, find, findIndex, findLast. Fixed sparse array handling edge cases.

### Functions with 100% Coverage (118 total)

- **Math (47)**: absoluteValue, add, binomialCoefficient, ceiling, clamp, combinations, cubeRoot, decrement, digitSum, divide, divisors, exponential, factorial, fibonacci, floor, gcd, geometricMean, harmonicMean, increment, inRange, isEven, isOdd, isPrime, lcm, logarithm, logarithmBase10, max, min, multiply, negate, permutations, power, primeFactorization, product, quadratic, round, sign, squareRoot, subtract, sum, totient, truncate

### Key Lessons Learned

- JavaScript floating-point arithmetic has inherent limitations that tests must respect
- Mathematical properties that hold in theory may not hold exactly in JavaScript
- fast-check requires `Math.fround()` for float constraint boundaries
- Tests should focus on practical correctness within JavaScript's capabilities, not theoretical perfection
- Using tolerance-based comparisons is essential for floating-point tests

## Critical Instructions - READ FIRST

### ⚠️ CRITICAL TEST WRITING RULES - DO NOT IGNORE ⚠️

**ALWAYS write tests correctly THE FIRST TIME. These issues occur EVERY session:**

1. **Property-based tests with fast-check:**
   - ❌ NEVER put `fc.assert()` inside `await t.step()` - it will silently fail!
   - ✅ ALWAYS use separate `Deno.test()` calls for each property test
   - ✅ ALWAYS use `Math.fround()` on min/max constraints for `fc.float()`
   ```typescript
   // WRONG - Will appear to pass but doesn't actually run!
   Deno.test("properties", async (t) => {
     await t.step("some property", () => {
       fc.assert(...) // THIS DOESN'T WORK!
     })
   })

   // CORRECT - Separate test
   Deno.test("some property", () => {
     fc.assert(
       fc.property(
         fc.float({ noNaN: true, min: Math.fround(0.1), max: Math.fround(100) }),
         (x) => { ... }
       )
     )
   })
   ```

2. **JSDoc examples:**
   - ❌ NEVER copy JSDoc example values without verifying them first
   - ✅ ALWAYS run the actual function to check the correct output
   - ✅ ALWAYS use the actual computed values in tests, not the JSDoc values if they differ

3. **Floating-point comparisons:**
   - ❌ NEVER use `===` for floating-point equality
   - ✅ ALWAYS use `approximately()` helper or `assertAlmostEquals()`
   - ✅ ALWAYS use `Object.is()` for NaN and -0/+0 comparisons

4. **Complete Quality Standards - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
   - ✅ 100% code coverage (rare justified `// deno-coverage-ignore` only)
   - ✅ ALL tests must pass
   - ✅ Type checking must pass completely (`deno test` with NO `--no-check`)
   - ✅ NO linter errors (`deno lint` must be clean)
   - ❌ NEVER claim work is done without meeting ALL these standards
   - ❌ Anything less than this is unacceptable, sloppy work

5. **Run ALL checks BEFORE claiming success:**
   - ✅ Run tests: `deno test --unstable-temporal 'libraries/toolkit/tests/**/*.test.ts'`
   - ✅ Check types: Tests must pass WITHOUT `--no-check` flag
   - ✅ Check linting: `deno lint libraries/toolkit/tests/**/*.test.ts`
   - ✅ Check coverage: `deno task test:toolkit:cov`

6. **ALWAYS update BOTH files after completing tests:**
   - ✅ Update `/libraries/toolkit/FUNCTION_LIST.md` - progress percentage and function list
   - ✅ Update `/libraries/toolkit/tests/PROMPT.md` - session achievements and coverage count
   - ✅ Verify both show the SAME numbers before committing

### 1. Quality Standards (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS)

**Work is NOT complete until:**

- ✅ 100% code coverage achieved
- ✅ ALL tests passing
- ✅ Type checking passing (no `--no-check` flag needed)
- ✅ ZERO linter errors
- **This is the minimum acceptable standard. Anything less is unfinished work.**

### 2. Project Standards (MUST READ)

Before ANY work, you MUST read and follow these files IN ORDER:

1. `/CLAUDE.md` - Project-wide coding standards and prime directive
2. `/libraries/toolkit/tests/TESTING_POLICY.md` - Testing requirements and patterns
3. `/libraries/toolkit/FUNCTION_LIST.md` - Complete list of functions to test with progress tracking

**PRIME DIRECTIVE from CLAUDE.md**: DO NOT ASSUME ANYTHING. DO NOT TAKE SHORTCUTS. DO NOT GUESS. Check everything carefully before acting, especially before writing code or committing.

### 3. File Naming Convention (CRITICAL)

The project uses a specific naming convention that MUST be followed:

- Function/component names go on the **folder**, NOT the file
- Every folder must have an `index.test.ts` file
- Example: `tests/behaviors/algebraic/commutative/add/index.test.ts` (NOT `add.test.ts`)
- When moving/renaming files, ALWAYS update all import paths

### 4. Import Path Structure

From test files in `tests/behaviors/[category]/[subcategory]/[function]/`:

- To source: Use appropriate relative path (typically 4-5 levels up)
- To helpers: Use appropriate relative path (typically 3-4 levels up)
- Example: `import clamp from "../../../../src/simple/math/clamp/index.ts"`

### 5. Common Edge Cases That Are Often Incorrect

**These edge cases are frequently implemented wrong - ALWAYS verify:**

- **Permutations**: P(n,n) = P(n,n-1) = n! (they're equal, not monotonic at the end)
- **Exponential**: exp(Number.MIN_VALUE) returns exactly 1, not slightly > 1
- **Logarithm**: log(Infinity)(x) has special behaviors, not always NaN
- **Cube Root**: JSDoc examples may have calculation errors - always verify
- **Curried Functions**: Need null/undefined checks on BOTH parameter applications
- **Floating Point**: Use `Object.is()` for -0/+0 distinction and NaN comparison

### 6. Linting Compliance (MANDATORY)

**Common linting issues to avoid:**

- ❌ NO `any` types - use specific types or `unknown` when truly unknown
- ❌ NO sparse arrays without `// deno-lint-ignore no-sparse-arrays`
- ❌ NO `let` for variables that aren't reassigned - use `const`
- ❌ NO unused variables - prefix with `_` if intentional
- ❌ NO type assertions to `any` - find a proper type
- ✅ For sparse arrays in tests: Add `// deno-lint-ignore no-sparse-arrays`
- ✅ For unavoidable `any`: Use `unknown` or add `// deno-lint-ignore no-explicit-any`
- ✅ Always run `deno lint` before claiming completion

### 7. Test File Structure

```typescript
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std@0.218.0/assert/mod.ts"
import * as fc from "npm:fast-check@3"

import functionName from "[relative-path-to-source]"

Deno.test("functionName - test description", () => {
	// Test implementation
})
```

## Definition of Done (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Work is NOT complete and CANNOT be committed until ALL of these are met:**

✅ **100% Code Coverage**

- Run: `deno task test:toolkit:cov`
- Rare exceptions with `// deno-coverage-ignore` must be justified

✅ **All Tests Passing**

- Run: `deno test --unstable-temporal 'libraries/toolkit/tests/**/*.test.ts'`
- Zero failures, no skipped tests

✅ **Type Checking Passes**

- Tests must pass WITHOUT `--no-check` flag
- No TypeScript errors whatsoever

✅ **Zero Linter Errors**

- Run: `deno lint libraries/toolkit/tests/**/*.test.ts`
- Must return "Checked X files" with no errors

**This is the Definition of Done. Anything less is incomplete, unacceptable work.**

## Session Workflow (COMPLETE THESE STEPS IN ORDER)

### 1. Select Functions to Test (Maximum 6)

- Check FUNCTION_LIST.md for untested functions
- Group related functions when possible
- Prioritize core functionality

### 2. Write Comprehensive Tests

For each function:

- Property-based tests using fast-check
- JSDoc example coverage (100% required)
- Edge cases (null, undefined, NaN, Infinity)
- Error handling
- Behavioral properties

### 3. Verify Definition of Done

**MUST complete ALL before proceeding:**

```bash
# 1. Run tests (must all pass)
deno test --unstable-temporal 'libraries/toolkit/tests/**/*.test.ts'

# 2. Check linting (must be clean)
deno lint libraries/toolkit/tests/**/*.test.ts

# 3. Check coverage (must be 100%)
deno task test:toolkit:cov
```

Fix ANY issues before proceeding. Do NOT continue if any check fails.

### 4. Update Documentation

- Update FUNCTION_LIST.md:
  - Mark tested functions with ✓ on the same line
  - Update progress percentage at the top
  - **UPDATE ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETION**:
    - Calculate remaining functions (854 - completed)
    - Use ~12 minutes per function average
    - Update hours remaining and working days estimate
    - Update the "Last updated" date
- Update this PROMPT.md file for the next session
- Nested `Deno.test` calls need flattening
- Remaining `expect` statements need conversion to `assertEquals`
- Import paths need verification

### Fix Template

```typescript
// Replace: expect(value).toBe(expected)
// With: assertEquals(value, expected)

// Replace: expect(value).toBeNaN()
// With: assertEquals(Number.isNaN(value), true)

// Replace: expect(value).toEqual(expected)
// With: assertEquals(value, expected)
```

## Next Session Priority

1. **Array utility functions** (continue with untested array functions):
   - `isEmpty` - Checks if array is empty
   - `compact` - Removes falsy values from array
   - `aperture` - Sliding window of consecutive n-tuples
   - `cartesianProduct` / `xprod` - Cartesian product of two arrays
   - `closest` - Finds value closest to target number
   - `combinations` - Generates all combinations of array elements

2. **Array range and generation functions**:
   - `range` - Generates array of numbers from start to end
   - `rangeStep` - Like range but with custom step value
   - `repeat` - Repeats array n times
   - `repeatItem` - Creates array with element repeated n times
   - `times` - Calls a function n times and collects results

3. **Array grouping and partitioning**:
   - `groupBy` - Groups elements by key function
   - `partition` - Splits array into two based on predicate
   - `splitAt` - Splits array at given index
   - `splitEvery` - Splits array into chunks of size n
   - `span` - Splits array where predicate first becomes false

4. **Array zip and combination functions**:
   - `zip` - Combines corresponding elements from two arrays
   - `zipWith` - Combines arrays using a function
   - `unzip` - Separates array of pairs into two arrays
   - `interleave` - Alternates elements from multiple arrays
   - `transpose` - Transposes matrix (array of arrays)

## Testing Patterns Reference

### Property-Based Testing - IMPORTANT NOTES

**WARNING**: Be very careful with `fc.anything()` - it can generate objects that break native JavaScript operations:

- Objects with toString as non-function properties
- Objects that can't be converted to primitives
- Always use try-catch or more specific generators when testing functions that rely on JavaScript's type coercion

### Property-Based Testing

```typescript
fc.assert(
	fc.property(
		fc.float({ noNaN: true }),
		(value) => {
			// Property assertion
		},
	),
	{ numRuns: 1000 },
)
```

### Floating-Point Comparison

```typescript
import approximately from "[path]/helpers/assertions/approximately/index.ts"
assertEquals(approximately(result, expected, epsilon), true)
```

### NaN Handling

```typescript
assertEquals(Number.isNaN(result), true)
// NOT: assertEquals(result, NaN)
```

## Important Reminders

### Coverage Requirements

- Code Coverage: 100% (use `deno task test:toolkit:cov`)
- JSDoc Examples: 100% (consolidate if >10 examples)
- Behavioral Coverage: All documented behaviors
- Edge Cases: null, undefined, NaN, Infinity, empty collections

### Common Pitfalls

- Don't use `===` for NaN comparison
- Use relative epsilon for floating-point comparisons
- Test curried function parameter order carefully
- Ensure imports use correct relative paths
- Remember to test immutability where applicable

### Git Workflow

1. Check changes: `git status`
2. Stage files: `git add -A`
3. Commit with conventional format:
   - `test(toolkit): add tests for [functions]`
   - Include coverage improvements in message
4. Reference any issues fixed

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Run all toolkit tests
deno test --unstable-temporal 'libraries/toolkit/tests/**/*.test.ts'

# Run with coverage
deno task test:toolkit:cov

# Run specific test file
deno test --unstable-temporal 'libraries/toolkit/tests/behaviors/[category]/[function]/index.test.ts'

# Run tests quietly
deno test --unstable-temporal 'libraries/toolkit/tests/**/*.test.ts' --quiet
```
