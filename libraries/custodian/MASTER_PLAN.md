## üìç **NEXT SESSION STARTS HERE**

**Current Focus**: Phase 1, Milestone 1.1 - Core Types with TDD

**Next Task**: Write `operation/index.test.ts` for UUID validation and method constraints

**Context Needed**:
- Query `functional_programming_rules` MCP for: "Result monad", "error handling", "discriminated unions"
- Query `typescript_rules` MCP for: "branded types", "type-level programming"
- Query `syntax_rules` MCP for: "naming conventions", "function declarations"

**Files to Create**: `src/types/Operation/index.test.ts` (test first!)

---

## Vision & Core Principles

### What We're Building

A **progressive state management library** that:
- Works without JavaScript (Lynx/IE11 compatibility)
- Encodes all UI state in URLs (stateless HTTP)
- Uses cryptographic continuations for resumable workflows
- Provides declarative state machines
- Integrates event sourcing via Operator
- Progressive enhancement (same model ¬± JS)

### Non-Negotiable Principles

1. **No JavaScript Required**: Everything must work in text browsers
2. **Idempotent Operations**: UUID-based, exactly-once semantics
3. **URL as State**: Complete UI state in query parameters
4. **Secure Continuations**: Signed, time-bound, tamper-proof tokens
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Same behavior with/without JS (just faster)
6. **Privacy First**: Public/private/ephemeral data boundaries
7. **Pure Functions**: No classes, no mutations, curried functions only
8. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests FIRST, then implementation

### Testing Philosophy

- **TDD Throughout**: Failing tests first, implement to pass
- **Test Location**: Alongside code as `index.test.ts`
- **Test Behavior**: What it does, not how
- **Integration Focus**: E2E and integration over unit tests
- **Property Testing**: Use `fast-check` (temporary until Quarrier)
- **No Internal Mocking**: Studio libraries work - trust them
- **External Mocking**: Use `msw` only for external APIs
- **Accessibility**: Test with `axe` where UI involved

**What to Mock**: External APIs, database writes, time operations, RNG
**What NOT to Mock**: Toolsmith, Artificer, Agent, Architect, any Studio internals

---

## MVP Scope (Phases 1-5)

The **minimum viable product** includes:

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Foundation - Core types and contracts
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: No-JS Implementation - Server-side state management
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Continuations - Resumable workflows
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: State Machines - Declarative transitions
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5**: Progressive Enhancement - JavaScript layer

**MVP Goal**: Working state management in Lynx, enhanced in modern browsers. State machines with continuations. No visual designer, no collaboration, no analytics.

**Post-MVP** (Phases 6-15): Visual designer, real-time collaboration, analytics, etc.

## Session Resumption Guide

### For Future AI Sessions

When resuming work on Custodian:

1. **Read this file first** - It's the single source of truth
2. **Check "NEXT SESSION STARTS HERE"** marker at the top
3. **Read the current phase/milestone** context
4. **Query MCP servers** as indicated
5. **Write tests first** following TDD
6. **Implement to pass tests**
7. **Update checkboxes** as you go
8. **Update progress counters**
9. **Move "NEXT SESSION" marker** to next task
10. **Update "Last Updated"** timestamp

### Context Each Session Needs

- **Current Phase Goal**: What we're building
- **Dependencies**: What must be complete first
- **Testing Stack**: Deno.test, fast-check, msw, axe
- **Studio Rules**: Query MCP before coding
- **File Structure**: One function per file, tests alongside

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ‚ùå Don't implement before writing tests
- ‚ùå Don't mock Studio library internals
- ‚ùå Don't use classes, mutations, or arrow functions
- ‚ùå Don't skip property tests
- ‚ùå Don't forget Envoy comment syntax
- ‚ùå Don't violate constitutional rules

### Session Checklist

- [ ] Read MASTER_PLAN.md completely
- [ ] Check current phase and milestone
- [ ] Query MCP servers for context
- [ ] Write tests first (TDD)
- [ ] Implement to pass tests
- [ ] Update checkboxes and progress

  equals(apply(op1, uuid))(apply(op2, uuid))
)

// Reversibility
fc.property(fc.anything(), (state) =>
  equals(parse(encode(state)))(state)
)

// Associativity
fc.property(fc.anything(), fc.anything(), fc.anything(), (a, b, c) =>
  equals(merge(merge(a, b), c))(merge(a, merge(b, c)))
)

// State machine determinism
fc.property(fc.state(), fc.event(), (state, event) =>
