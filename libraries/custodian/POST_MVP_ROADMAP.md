# Custodian Post-MVP Roadmap

> **Post-MVP Enhancement Phases (6-15)**
>
> **Status**: Not Started - Implement Only After MVP Production Validation
> **Last Updated**: 2025-01-10
> **Total Tasks**: 299 tasks across 10 phases

---

## ⚠️ Important Notice

These phases are **NOT part of the MVP**. The MVP (Phases 1-5) must be completed, tested in production, and validated with real users before beginning any post-MVP work.

**MVP Must Achieve**:
- ✅ Works without JavaScript in all browsers
- ✅ Works in Lynx text browser  
- ✅ All UI state in URLs
- ✅ Forms use idempotent operations
- ✅ Continuations cryptographically secure
- ✅ State machines pure and deterministic
- ✅ Progressive enhancement seamless
- ✅ All tests passing with 100% behavior coverage

Only after MVP success should post-MVP phases be considered.

## Philosophy

Post-MVP phases should enhance, not complicate. Every feature must:

1. **Preserve MVP Principles**
   - No JavaScript required for core functionality
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Privacy-first
   - Pure functions

2. **Add Real Value**
   - Solve real user problems
   - Based on production feedback
   - Measurable improvements
   - User testing validated

3. **Maintain Quality**
   - Same testing rigor as MVP
   - Property tests for invariants
   - Security audits
   - Performance benchmarks

4. **Stay True to Vision**
   - Web-native architecture
   - Semantic data storage
   - Functional purity
   - Accessibility first

## Notes for Future Implementers

- **Don't rush**: MVP validation is critical
- **Stay focused**: One phase at a time
- **Test thoroughly**: Post-MVP features are optional, so they must be excellent
- **Listen to users**: Let production usage guide priorities
- **Maintain quality**: Post-MVP doesn't mean lower standards
- **Document everything**: Future maintainers need context
- **Keep it simple**: Complexity is the enemy

This roadmap will evolve based on MVP learnings and production feedback. The goal is not to build everything, but to build the right things well.
