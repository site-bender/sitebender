# How to handel Sitebender Studio testing without mocks

MSW (Mock Service Worker) is a network-level API mocking library that intercepts HTTP traffic at the boundary where your app talks to the network, not inside your app’s code. It works in:

- Browsers: via a Service Worker that transparently intercepts fetch and XHR requests from pages it controls.
- Node/test environments: via HTTP/HTTPS request interception (without patching your app code).

## What it does (in detail)

- Route-level mocking: You define request handlers (e.g., for REST endpoints, GraphQL operations). When a request matches, MSW returns a mock res ponse; otherwise it can passthrough to the real network or error on unhandled requests.
- Black‑box testing: Because it runs at the network boundary, your application remains unmodified (no swapping of fetch/axios clients, no DI gymnastics). Your tests and dev environment use the app exactly as in production, but responses are controlled.
- Realistic behavior: You can simulate latencies, network errors, status codes, headers, JSON bodies, file/binary payloads, redirects, and conditional logic based on request body/headers/cookies.
- Reusability across environments: The same handlers can be used in local dev, Storybook, Cypress/Playwright end‑to‑end tests, unit/integration tests, and even demos. That reduces duplication and drift.
- Passthrough and layering: Handlers can allow requests to hit the real backend (useful during incremental adoption), or selectively forward to upstream and decorate/transform responses.
- Introspection and safety rails: It can warn or fail tests on unknown/unmocked requests, helping catch accidental network calls, missing handlers, and contract drift.
- First‑class GraphQL: Match by operation name, build dynamic responses, and simulate GraphQL error envelopes and partial data.
- TypeScript and good DX: Well‑typed handler APIs, good logs, and common integrations with popular bundlers, frameworks, and test runners.

## Pros

- True black‑box mocking: Works with any HTTP client, preserves your app’s runtime behavior, and reduces flakiness versus stubbing internals.
- Single source of truth: Share the same handlers across dev, tests, and Storybook; less duplication than per‑test manual mocks.
- High fidelity: Easy to model real network characteristics (timeouts, retries, backoff behavior validation).
- Safer tests: Optional “error on unknown request” catches leaky dependencies and missing contracts early.
- Incremental adoption: Start with passthrough, then add handlers where needed.
- Framework‑agnostic: Works with React/Vue/Svelte/Next/Remix/etc., and with Jest/Vitest/Cypress/Playwright.

## Cons / trade‑offs

- Service Worker lifecycle quirks: Requires HTTPS/localhost, controlled scope, and occasional cache/update gotchas (workers don’t always update until reload). This can confuse newcomers.
- Cross‑origin limitations (browser): Service workers only control their scope; mocking multi‑origin calls can need extra setup or a proxy workaround.
- Risk of stale mocks: If handlers diverge from real API contracts, you get false confidence. You must invest in keeping mocks aligned with backend schemas/specs.
- Streaming/realtime edges: WebSockets aren’t interceptable by SW; Server‑Sent Events and fetch streaming work but are trickier to model realistically and historically had rough edges.
- Node/test interop: Interception can conflict with other tools (e.g., nock), custom agents, or unusual HTTP libraries; fetch/undici/axios variations can need care in setup.
- Performance in large suites: Hundreds of handlers across many test files can add cognitive overhead. Matching specificity and handler ordering matter.
- Setup ceremony: Initial worker registration, environment wiring, “where to put handlers,” and toggling fail‑on‑unknown can be a bit of upfront work.

## What to add or change if building it today

- Contract‑aware, type‑safe mocks by default
  - First‑class OpenAPI/GraphQL integration: generate typed handlers from a spec, validate incoming requests and outgoing responses at runtime in dev/tests, and fail loudly on contract drift.
  - CLI: “msw import openapi.yaml” to scaffold handlers, factories, and sample data; watch mode to keep mocks in sync.
- Statefulness and scenarios
  - Built‑in in‑memory data store with schema inference, CRUD helpers, and deterministic seeding. Easy reset per test, plus named “scenarios” (e.g., empty state, premium user, erroring payments).
  - Time control hooks (advance clock, simulate TTL/expirations) and global toggles for chaos/latency/error rates.
- Realtime & streaming improvements
  - First‑class SSE streaming utilities (chunked responses, backpressure simulation), and an optional local proxy adapter to emulate WebSocket servers for tests (since SW can’t intercept WS).
- DevTools you can live in
  - Browser extension and Node TUI to view intercepted requests, reorder/mute/toggle handlers, tweak response bodies/latency, and export a changed handler.
  - Record‑and‑replay: capture real traffic and generate starter handlers/tests from traces; redaction and data classification built‑in.
- Multi‑origin/proxy story
  - Hybrid mode: if SW can’t control a target origin, spin up a lightweight local proxy that MSW drives, giving seamless cross‑origin mocking in dev and E2E.
- First‑class framework/runtimes adapters
  - Turnkey plugins for Vite/Next/Remix/SvelteKit/Nuxt and for test runners (Vitest/Jest/Playwright/Cypress).
  - Multi‑runtime support out of the box: Node, Deno, Bun, Edge/Service‑Worker runtimes (Cloudflare, Workers), consistent APIs.
- Guardrails and safety
  - “Impossible to ship” production guard with compile‑time checks and runtime asserts.
  - CI mode that fails on unknown requests and prints a diff (expected vs. actual contract).
- Matching and performance
  - Route trie and priority rules for O(k) matching at scale, robust conflict diagnostics, and handler discovery reports (unused/overlapping handlers).
- DX improvements
  - One‑command setup that registers/updates the SW file correctly, avoids cache races, and auto‑links to DevTools.
  - Scenario files alongside feature modules, with co‑located factories and per‑story overrides for Storybook.

## Minimal example (mental model)

- Dev: Start MSW, app keeps using fetch/XHR, MSW intercepts and returns mocked JSON with configurable delay and headers. Unknown routes can pass through to real API.
- Tests: Start MSW in Node with the same handlers. Unknown routes fail tests by default so you catch missing mocks. Handlers are easy to override per test case.

## Bottom line

MSW is the right abstraction layer for API mocking because it behaves like the network. The main improvements I’d prioritize are schema‑driven type‑safe mocks, better realtime/streaming, a great DevTools/record‑replay story, cross‑origin ergonomics, and first‑class adapters for modern runtimes and frameworks.
