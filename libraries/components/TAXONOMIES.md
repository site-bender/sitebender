**IMPORTANT NOTE (READ THIS!):** This is purely brainstorming ideas for how to expand the component library for maximum semantic power. We may do all, some, or none of these, or may do them differently. We will discuss this in depth when the time comes.

Here is a comprehensive, nested tree structure of JSX components designed to cover the entire taxonomy of literature we've discussed. Components are namespaced using dot notation for clarity (e.g., `Poem.Line` vs. `Song.Line`).

### Key Features of This Structure:

1. **Namespacing:** Components are grouped by their parent structure (e.g., `Poem.Line` vs. `Song.Line`). This prevents naming collisions and makes the component's purpose immediately clear.
2. **Composition:** The tree is deeply nested, reflecting how literature is built. A `Sonnet` is composed of `Stanzas`, which are composed of `Lines`.
3. **Abstraction:** Components like `<FixedForm>` act as abstract base classes, implying that concrete implementations like `<Sonnet>` would have validation logic (e.g., enforcing 14 lines).
4. **Metadata:** Components are designed to accept rich props (`author`, `era`, `type`, `theory`) that describe the literary content, not just style it.
5. **Comprehensive Coverage:** This tree includes components for every level of our taxonomy:
   - **Macro Format:** `Series`, `Volume`, `Library`
   - **Content Genre:** `ScienceFiction` (via `GenreProvider`), `Satire`, `Tragedy`
   - **Structural Format:** `Sonnet`, `Chapter`, `Act`, `Scene`, `Stanza`
   - **Micro Format:** `Line`, `Dialogue`, `Footnote`, `PullQuote`

This library would allow a developer to "assemble" a piece of literature in code that is semantically meaningful, structurally sound, and thematically rich.

## More

A comprehensive library for organizing human knowledge and creative output requires multiple, overlapping taxonomic lenses. Each taxonomy serves a different purpose and answers a different question about a work.

Here are several other essential taxonomies you could create, moving from the intrinsic qualities of the work to its extrinsic context and reception.

---

### 1. Thematic Taxonomy (What is it about?)

This taxonomy categorizes works by their central themes, motifs, and subject matter. This is often cross-genre.

- **Core Human Experiences:** Love, Loss, Death, Coming of Age, Identity, Isolation, Belonging, Rebellion, Faith, Betrayal, Justice, War, Peace.
- **Social & Political Themes:** Class Struggle, Utopia/Dystopia, Totalitarianism, Revolution, Racism, Feminism, Colonialism/Post-Colonialism, Migration, The American Dream.
- **Philosophical & Existential Themes:** Free Will vs. Determinism, The Nature of Reality, The Meaning of Life, Good vs. Evil, The Absurd, Consciousness, Technology & Humanity.
- **Settings as Theme:** The City, The Wilderness, The Sea, Space, The Past, The Future.

**Usage:** Tagging a dystopian novel (_1984_), a post-apocalyptic film (_Mad Max_), and a protest song ("Masters of War") with the theme **"Power and Corruption."**

### 2. Chronological Taxonomy (When was it made and set?)

This dual-axis taxonomy places a work in historical context.

- **Date of Creation:**
  - **Eras:** Ancient, Classical, Medieval, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Romantic, Victorian, Modernist, Postmodern, Contemporary.
  - **Decades:** The Roaring Twenties, The Depression Era, The Sixties, etc. (Crucial for cultural context).
- **Historical Setting (Diegetic Time):**
  - Prehistory, Antiquity, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Napoleonic Era, World War I, World War II, The Cold War, The Future, Alternate History.

**Usage:** Understanding the difference between a **Victorian** novel written in the 1850s (e.g., _Hard Times_) and a **Neo-Victorian** novel written in the 2000s (e.g., _The Crimson Petal and the White_).

### 3. Geographical & Cultural Taxonomy (Where is it from and set?)

This taxonomy maps the origin and setting of a work, essential for world literature.

- **Cultural Origin:** The nationality, ethnicity, or cultural tradition of the author/creator.
  - e.g., Nigerian Literature, Japanese Cinema, Italian Renaissance Art, Appalachian Folk Music.
- **Setting (Diegetic Location):**
  - **Real:** London, Paris, New York, Tokyo, the Mississippi River, the Australian Outback.
  - **Imagined:** Middle-earth, Westeros, the Star Wars Galaxy, Ankh-Morpork.

**Usage:** Distinguishing between **Magical Realism** from Colombia (Gabriel García Márquez) vs. Japan (Haruki Murakami).

### 4. Taxonomic Taxonomy (Formal Complexity)

This meta-taxonomy classifies works by their structural complexity and relationship to other works. This is incredibly powerful for a library.

- **Standalone Work:** A complete, self-contained entity (e.g., a single poem, a short story, a film).
- **Series:** A sequence of formally similar but narratively independent works (e.g., _The Canterbury Tales_, James Bond films).
- **Sequence:** A group of works meant to be experienced in a specific order.
  - **Duology, Trilogy, Quadrilogy, etc.**
  - **Cycle:** A set of works that are interconnected and form a larger whole (e.g., Arthurian Cycle, The Cthulhu Mythos).
- **Universe:** A shared fictional setting inhabited by characters and events from multiple series and sequences (e.g., the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Cosmere).
- **Franchise:** The commercial manifestation of a universe, encompassing all media (books, films, games, merchandise).

**Usage:** A library could show a user how a single **Standalone Work** (a novel) fits into a **Sequence** (a trilogy), which is part of a larger **Series** (other books by the author), all set within a shared **Universe**.

### 5. Tonal & Affective Taxonomy (How does it feel?)

This taxonomy categorizes works by the emotional response or mood they are intended to evoke.

- **Tone:** Serious, Humorous, Ironic, Satirical, Solemn, Whimsical, Melodramatic, Noir, Hopeful, Cynical.
- **Affect (Emotional Response):** Uplifting, Tragic, Terrifying, Thought-provoking, Nostalgic, Cathartic, Romantic, suspenseful.

**Usage:** Differentiating between a **Horror** film that is _Terrifying_ (_The Exorcist_) vs. one that is _Ironic_ and _Humorous_ (_Shaun of the Dead_).

### 6. Modal Taxonomy (How is it experienced?)

This taxonomy is defined by the sense or mode of engagement required by the audience.

- **Textual:** Novel, Poem, Essay (consumed by reading).
- **Aural:** Song, Podcast, Symphony, Audiobook (consumed by listening).
- **Visual:** Painting, Sculpture, Photography, Graphic Novel (consumed by looking).
- **Audio-Visual:** Film, Television, Theater, Video Game, Dance (consumed by watching and listening).
- **Tactile/Interactive:** Video Game, Interactive Fiction, Choose-Your-Own-Adventure, Installation Art (consumed by doing).

**Usage:** This is crucial for accessibility and discovery. A user could search for all **Audio** versions of a **Textual** work.

### 7. Canon & Reception Taxonomy (What is its cultural status?)

This taxonomy is about the work's reputation and place in cultural discourse.

- **Canonical Status:** Classic, Cult Classic, Contemporary Acclaimed, Popular, Obscure, Forgotten, Banned.
- **Critical Reception:** Masterpiece, Controversial, Panned, Divisive, Underrated.
- **Award Status:** Pulitzer Prize Winner, Booker Prize Shortlist, Oscar Winner, etc.

**Usage:** Creating a shelf for "**Banned** Books" or "**Pulitzer Prize** Winners."

### 8. Character & Narrative Taxonomy (Who is it about and what happens?)

This taxonomy delves into the story itself.

- **Character Archetypes:** The Hero, The Mentor, The Trickster, The Villain, The Anti-Hero, The Everyman.
- **Plot Structures:** The Hero's Journey, Rags to Riches, Tragedy, Revenge, Mystery, Quest, Rebellion.
- **Point of View:** First-Person, Third-Person Limited, Third-Person Omniscient, Unreliable Narrator.

**Usage:** Finding all "**Quest**" narratives or stories with an "**Unreliable Narrator**."

### Synthesizing the Taxonomies: A Complete Example

A single work, like **Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_**, would be tagged across all these taxonomies:

- **Genre:** Gothic Fiction, Science Fiction, Literary Fiction, Tragedy
- **Format:** Novel, Epistolary Frame Narrative
- **Theme:** Ambition, Responsibility, Creation, Isolation, The Other, Nature vs. Nurture
- **Chronology:** **Written:** Romantic Era (1818); **Set:** 18th Century
- **Geography:** **Author:** British; **Setting:** Switzerland, the Arctic, Germany
- **Taxonomic:** Standalone Work (though part of a cultural cycle of adaptations)
- **Tonal:** Melancholy, Horrific, Thought-provoking, Tragic
- **Modal:** Textual
- **Canon/Reception:** Classic, Canonical, Controversial (in its time)
- **Narrative:** Tragedy, Quest (for knowledge, for revenge), features a "Creature" archetype.

This multi-dimensional approach allows a library to be incredibly powerful. A user could ask: _"Find me a **Tragic Science Fiction** **Novel** from the **19th Century** that deals with the theme of **Isolation**."_ And the system would know to return _Frankenstein_.

## Implementation

Trying to represent every taxonomy as a JSX component would lead to a deeply unnatural and cumbersome API. The key design principle is:

> **Use JSX Components for things that are _structural_ and have _nested content_. Use props (including enums) for things that are _attributive_ and _descriptive_.**

Let's break down how each taxonomy would be implemented, moving from the previous structural components to the new attributive ones.

---

### 1. Structural Taxonomies → JSX Components

These define the _architecture_ of the content and are perfect for JSX. This is what we had in the first tree.

**Example: A Poem**

```jsx
// This is good JSX. It defines a structure that contains other things.
<Poem title="Ozymandias" author="Percy Bysshe Shelley">
	<Poem.Stanza>
		<Poem.Line>I met a traveller from an antique land,</Poem.Line>
		<Poem.Line>Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</Poem.Line>
		<Poem.Line>Stand in the desert. . . .</Poem.Line>
	</Poem.Stanza>
	{/* ... more stanzas ... */}
</Poem>
```

**Example: A Chapter**

```jsx
// This is good JSX. It wraps a block of content.
<Chapter number={1} title="The Prison-Door">
	<Paragraph>
		A throng of bearded men, in sad-coloured garments and grey steeple-crowned
		hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods, and others bareheaded, was
		assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the door of which was heavily
		timbered with oak, and studded with iron spikes.
	</Paragraph>
</Chapter>
```

---

### 2. Attributive Taxonomies → Enumerated Props

These describe _qualities_ _of_ the content. They are data, not structure. For these, we extend the props of our structural components.

**Thematic, Tonal, Chronological, etc. taxonomies become props.**

Let's define a central `metadata` prop (or a set of individual props) that accepts values from enumerated constants.

#### Step 1: Define the Enums (A "Dictionary")

This is where you define the allowed values for your taxonomies. This could be a simple object or a more complex module.

```javascript
// literature-taxonomies.js (A central "dictionary" for the app)

// Themes
export const THEMES = {
	ISOLATION: "isolation",
	AMBITION: "ambition",
	JUSTICE: "justice",
	LOVE: "love",
	// ... many more
}

// Genres
export const GENRES = {
	SCI_FI: "science_fiction",
	GOTHIC: "gothic_fiction",
	LITERARY: "literary_fiction",
	SATIRE: "satire",
	// ... many more
}

// Eras (Chronological - Creation)
export const ERAS = {
	ROMANTIC: "romantic",
	VICTORIAN: "victorian",
	MODERNIST: "modernist",
	POSTMODERN: "postmodern",
	// ... many more
}

// Tones
export const TONES = {
	MELANCHOLY: "melancholy",
	SERIOUS: "serious",
	HUMOROUS: "humorous",
	IRONIC: "ironic",
	// ... many more
}
```

#### Step 2: Apply the Enums as Props to Structural Components

Now we apply this metadata to our components.

```jsx
// Import the enums
import { ERAS, GENRES, THEMES, TONES } from "./literature-taxonomies"

// Apply them as props to the structural Work component
<Work
	title="Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus"
	author="Mary Shelley"
	// Attributive Taxonomies as Props
	genres={[GENRES.GOTHIC, GENRES.SCI_FI, GENRES.LITERARY]} // Multiple genres allowed
	themes={[THEMES.AMBITION, THEMES.ISOLATION, THEMES.CREATION]}
	eraOfCreation={ERAS.ROMANTIC}
	tone={TONES.MELANCHOLY}
	// Other specific metadata
	setting="Switzerland, the Arctic, 18th Century"
	canonicalStatus="classic"
>
	<Chapter number={1} title="Letter I">
		<Paragraph>
			You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement
			of an enterprise...
		</Paragraph>
	</Chapter>
	{/* ... rest of the novel ... */}
</Work>
```

#### Implementation of the `Work` Component

The `Work` component itself doesn't _render_ these props. It consumes them and uses them for three purposes:

1. **Data Attributes:** Attach them to the DOM for CSS targeting (e.g., `.work[data-tones*="melancholy"]`).
2. **Context:** Provide them via React Context to deeply nested child components.
3. **Metadata:** Export them as part of a data object for sorting/filtering.

```jsx
// A simplified implementation of the <Work> component
function Work({ genres, themes, tone, eraOfCreation, children, ...restProps }) {
	// 1. Create a context value for all metadata
	const metadataContext = useMemo(() => ({
		genres,
		themes,
		tone,
		eraOfCreation,
		...restProps, // title, author, etc.
	}), [genres, themes, tone, eraOfCreation, restProps])

	// 2. Pass context down
	return (
		<article
			// 3. Attach as data attributes for styling
			data-genres={genres.join(" ")}
			data-themes={themes.join(" ")}
			data-tone={tone}
			data-era={eraOfCreation}
			className="literary-work"
		>
			<WorkMetadataContext.Provider value={metadataContext}>
				{children}
			</WorkMetadataContext.Provider>
		</article>
	)
}
```

---

### 3. Hybrid Approach: Thematic "Provider" Components

For the _Thematic_ taxonomy, a hybrid approach could make sense if the theme profoundly alters the _rendering_ of all nested content.

```jsx
// This is optional, but powerful if you need theming.
// It uses Context to style all children based on a theme.

// Definition
function DystopianTheme({ children }) {
	return (
		<div
			className="theme-dystopian"
			style={{/* stark colors, grim typography */}}
		>
			{children}
		</div>
	)
}

// Usage - It wraps structural components
<DystopianTheme>
	<Work
		title="1984"
		author="George Orwell"
		genres={[GENRES.DYSTOPIAN, GENRES.SCI_FI]}
		themes={[THEMES.TOTALITARIANISM, THEMES.SURVEILLANCE]}
	>
		<Chapter number={1}>
			It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
		</Chapter>
	</Work>
</DystopianTheme>
```

### Summary: The Final API

Putting it all together, a comprehensive literary work would be built like this:

```jsx
// Import our enums
import {
	ERAS,
	GENRES,
	NARRATIVE_STRUCTURES,
	THEMES,
	TONES,
} from "./literature-taxonomies"

// Compose the work
<Work
	title="Hamlet"
	author="William Shakespeare"
	// --- Attributive Taxonomies as Props ---
	genres={[GENRES.TRAGEDY, GENRES.REVENGE_PLAY]}
	themes={[THEMES.MADNESS, THEMES.REVENGE, THEMES.MORTALITY]}
	eraOfCreation={ERAS.ENGLISH_RENAISSANCE}
	narrativeStructure={NARRATIVE_STRUCTURES.TRAGEDY}
	tones={[TONES.MELANCHOLY, TONES.IRONIC, TONES.SOLEMN]}
	settings={["Denmark", "Elsinore Castle"]}
	canonicalStatus="classic"
>
	{/* --- Structural Taxonomies as JSX --- */}
	<DramatisPersonae>
		<Character name="Hamlet" role="Prince of Denmark" />
		<Character name="Claudius" role="King of Denmark, Hamlet's uncle" />
	</DramatisPersonae>

	<Act number={1}>
		<Scene number={1} setting="A platform before the castle.">
			<Dialogue speaker="BERNARDO">Who's there?</Dialogue>
			<Dialogue speaker="FRANCISCO">
				Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
			</Dialogue>
		</Scene>
	</Act>

	<Act number={3}>
		<Scene number={1} setting="A room in the castle.">
			<Dialogue speaker="HAMLET">
				To be, or not to be, that is the question:
			</Dialogue>
		</Scene>
	</Act>
</Work>
```

This approach gives you the best of both worlds:

1. **The power of JSX** for intuitively representing nested, structural content.
2. The **flexibility and simplicity of data** (enums and props) for describing abstract, multi-faceted attributes. This keeps the JSX clean, declarative, and easily processable by other parts of your application (e.g., a search filter can just read `work.props.genres`).
