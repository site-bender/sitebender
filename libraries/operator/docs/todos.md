## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Network reliability**: Implement retry logic, circuit breakers
- **Cryptographic complexity**: Use established libraries, get audits

### Process Risks

- **Scope creep**: Stick to phases, defer nice-to-haves
- **Integration complexity**: Test early with other libraries
- **Performance targets**: Profile continuously, optimize hotspots
- **Documentation drift**: Generate from code, never manual

## Notes

- Each phase can proceed somewhat in parallel after Phase 1
- Testing and verification happen continuously, not just Phase 7
- Warden governance applied from day one
- Envoy documentation generated throughout
- No classes, no mutations, no loops (except with Artificer approval)
- All code must be TSX-declarative, never imperative
- Every line of code stays true to Studio principles
