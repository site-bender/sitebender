# Operator Implementation Plan

> **Comprehensive roadmap for building Studio's pure functional pub/sub system with CQRS, event sourcing, and cryptographic ordering**

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of Operator from foundational event semantics to distributed workflow orchestration. Operator treats events as first-class RDF triples, enabling SPARQL queries over complete event history with cryptographic verification and causal consistency guarantees.

## Implementation Philosophy

- **Events as Data**: Every event is an immutable triple in the semantic store
- **CQRS by Default**: Commands produce events, queries are nullipotent
- **Cryptographic Ordering**: Hash chains + vector clocks, no blockchain bloat
- **Transport Agnostic**: Same semantics from DOM events to global P2P
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works in Lynx, scales to distributed systems
- **Workflow Foundation**: Event-driven orchestration replaces traditional state machines

## Phases

By treating events as RDF triples with CQRS and cryptographic ordering, Operator provides the foundation for distributed, offline-first, verifiable applications that scale from local DOM interactions to global P2P networks.

The implementation is ambitious but methodical, building from solid functional foundations to sophisticated workflow orchestration, always maintaining the principle that **events are data, and data is everything**.
