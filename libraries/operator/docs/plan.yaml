  overview:
    purpose: "Pure functional pub/sub system with CQRS, event sourcing, and cryptographic ordering"
    philosophy:
      - "Events as Data: Every event is an immutable triple in the semantic store"
      - "CQRS by Default: Commands produce events, queries are nullipotent"
      - "Cryptographic Ordering: Hash chains + vector clocks, no blockchain bloat"
      - "Transport Agnostic: Same semantics from DOM events to global P2P"
      - "Progressive Enhancement: Works in Lynx, scales to distributed systems"
      - "Workflow Foundation: Event-driven orchestration replaces traditional state machines"
    timeline: "12-18 months to v1.0.0 (ASAP, prioritized by value and dependencies)"

  success_metrics:
    functional:
      - "Events stored as RDF triples"
      - "SPARQL queries retrieve event history"
      - "CQRS pattern enforced"
      - "Cryptographic ordering guaranteed"
      - "Distributed events synchronized"
      - "Workflow orchestration functional"
    performance:
      - "1M+ events/second (local)"
      - "100K+ events/second (network)"
      - "< 1ms latency (p99, local)"
      - "< 10ms latency (p99, network)"
      - "Zero data loss"
      - "< 1s failover time"
    quality:
      - "100% test coverage"
      - "Property-based tests for invariants"
      - "Zero known security vulnerabilities"
      - "Documentation for all public APIs"
      - "Examples for common patterns"
