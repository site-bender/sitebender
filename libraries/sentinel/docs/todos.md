# Sentinel Implementation Plan

## Overview

Build authentication and authorization as declarative JSX components that compile to data in the triple store.

## Phase 1: Core Architecture (Week 1)

### Foundation

- [ ] Create library structure following Studio conventions
- [ ] Set up types for auth/authz domain
- [ ] Design IR extensions for security concepts
- [ ] Create base component interfaces

### Triple Store Schema

- [ ] Define auth ontology (users, roles, permissions)
- [ ] Create SHACL shapes for validation
- [ ] Design session triple patterns
- [ ] Define credential storage format

## Phase 2: Authentication Components (Week 2)

### Provider Components

- [ ] `<OAuthTwo>` with provider configurations
- [ ] `<WebAuthn>` with biometric support
- [ ] `<DidAuth>` for decentralized identity
- [ ] `<Magic>` for passwordless email/SMS
- [ ] `<Totp>` for 2FA

### Session Management

- [ ] `<Session>` container component
- [ ] Session storage in triple store
- [ ] Session refresh logic
- [ ] Secure cookie handling
- [ ] Csrf protection

### Credential Components

- [ ] `<VerifiableCredential>` issuance
- [ ] `<CredentialPresentation>` verification
- [ ] Did document resolution
- [ ] Signature verification

## Phase 3: Authorization Components (Week 2)

### Access Control Models

- [ ] `<Rbac>` role-based access control
- [ ] `<Abac>` attribute-based access control
- [ ] `<ReBAC>` relationship-based access control
- [ ] `<Policy>` custom policy definitions
- [ ] `<Permission>` granular permissions

### Policy Components

- [ ] `<SecureRoute>` for route protection
- [ ] `<SecureEndpoint>` for Api protection
- [ ] `<SecureComponent>` for UI elements
- [ ] `<When>` conditional access
- [ ] `<Grant>` and `<Deny>` decisions

### Policy Evaluation

- [ ] Policy evaluation engine
- [ ] Condition evaluator
- [ ] Context enrichment
- [ ] Decision caching
- [ ] Audit logging

## Phase 4: Security Features (Week 3)

### Rate Limiting

- [ ] `<RateLimit>` component
- [ ] Token bucket algorithm
- [ ] Sliding window implementation
- [ ] Per-user/IP/endpoint limits
- [ ] Distributed rate limiting

### Security Headers

- [ ] `<Csp>` content security policy
- [ ] `<Cors>` cross-origin configuration
- [ ] `<Hsts>` strict transport security
- [ ] `<FrameOptions>` clickjacking protection
- [ ] `<XssProtection>` Xss prevention

### Cryptography

- [ ] `<Encryption>` for data at rest
- [ ] `<Signing>` for data integrity
- [ ] `<Hashing>` for passwords
- [ ] `<ZeroKnowledge>` for privacy
- [ ] Key management components

## Phase 5: Testing Support (Week 3)

### Mock Components

- [ ] `<MockAuthentication>` test container
- [ ] `<MockUser>` with configurable attributes
- [ ] `<MockSession>` for session testing
- [ ] `<MockToken>` for token testing
- [ ] `<MockProvider>` for auth providers

### Test Scenarios

- [ ] `<AuthScenario>` test containers
- [ ] `<ExpectAuthenticated>` assertions
- [ ] `<ExpectDenied>` for access denial
- [ ] `<ExpectRedirect>` for redirects
- [ ] Time-based test scenarios

### Integration with Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Work with Agent's IO interception
- [ ] Coordinate with Artificer's TestHarness
- [ ] Integrate with Auditor's verification
- [ ] Connect to Envoy's observability

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Week 4)

### Zero-Knowledge Auth

- [ ] ZK proof generation
- [ ] ZK proof verification
- [ ] Anonymous credentials
- [ ] Selective disclosure
- [ ] Range proofs

### Distributed Identity

- [ ] Did method implementations
- [ ] Did resolution
- [ ] DidComm messaging
- [ ] Identity hubs
- [ ] Wallet integration

### Multi-Party Auth

- [ ] Multi-signature requirements
- [ ] Threshold signatures
- [ ] Social recovery
- [ ] Delegated authorization
- [ ] Capability-based security

## Phase 7: Integration (Week 4)

### With Other Libraries

- [ ] Agent: Distributed auth sync
- [ ] Artificer: Render secure components
- [ ] Auditor: Verify auth policies
- [ ] Custodian: Session state management
- [ ] Warden: Enforce security boundaries
- [ ] Envoy: Auth metrics and monitoring

### Production Features

- [ ] Auth migration tools
- [ ] Backup and recovery
- [ ] Key rotation
- [ ] Audit trail generation
- [ ] Compliance reports

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All auth logic as declarative JSX
- [ ] Zero auth code in application logic
- [ ] Formally verified security policies
- [ ] 100% test coverage via mocks
- [ ] < 100ms auth decisions
- [ ] Progressive enhancement works

## Priority Order

1. **Critical**: OAuthTwo + Rbac (most common needs)
2. **High**: Session management + secure routes
3. **Medium**: WebAuthn + Abac
4. **Low**: Zero-knowledge + distributed identity

## Notes

- Follow Studio conventions strictly
- No external auth libraries
- Everything must work without JavaScript
- Security policies stored as triples
- All components formally verifiable
