/**
 * InlineQuote component
 *
 * Renders a short inline quotation using the q element. Handles
 * proper quotation marks automatically based on nesting level
 * and language. Simpler than CitedQuote for brief quotes that
 * don't need full citation.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * She said <InlineQuote>Hello world</InlineQuote> and smiled.
 *
 * Or with language:
 *
 * The French say <InlineQuote lang="fr">C'est la vie</InlineQuote>.
