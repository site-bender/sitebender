## Implementation Notes

### Order of Attack
1. Start with clean slate and core types
2. Build PRNG and basic generators
3. Add shrinking immediately (not deferred)
4. Property engine with effects
5. Integration points
6. Advanced features
7. Documentation throughout

### Key Principles
- One function per file
- Named exports only
- No classes ever
- No mutation (except PRNG state)
- Result monad everywhere
- Direct imports (no barrels)
- Envoy comments mandatory

### Review Points
Stop for review after:
- PRNG implementation
- First 3 generators
- Shrink tree implementation
- Property runner
- Arborist integration
- Each major milestone

## Success Metrics
- Zero external dependencies achieved
- All properties deterministic
- Shrinking finds true minimal cases
- Performance competitive with fast-check
- Integration seamless with ecosystem
- Documentation comprehensive

## Current Status
**Phase**: Pre-implementation
**Next Step**: Archive current code, create folder structure
**Blocker**: None
**Timeline**: Rapid iteration, review-driven
