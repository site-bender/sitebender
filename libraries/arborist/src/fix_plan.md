# Arborist Rule Violations Fix Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic plan to fix all remaining issues in the `libraries/arborist/src` codebase. The library is **substantially complete and functional** (188/188 tests passing), but needs final polish to achieve zero-error state.

**Current Status**: Batches 1-4 COMPLETE. Batches 5-13 and critical fixes IN PROGRESS.

## CRITICAL: Task Completion Rules

**NO BATCH IS COMPLETE UNTIL ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE TRUE:**

1. âœ… All 188 tests pass: `deno task test` (with or without `--no-check` as appropriate)
2. âœ… All linting passes: `deno lint src/` reports 0 errors (NO EXCEPTIONS)
3. âœ… Type checking passes: `deno check src/` succeeds (for Arborist code)
4. âœ… This checklist updated: Batch marked with [x] in this document
5. âœ… Changes committed: Git commit includes code changes AND checklist updates

**If ANY of these fail, the batch is NOT complete. Fix the issues and verify again.**

## Current State Summary

### âœ… What Works (Batches 1-4 Complete)
- **All 188 tests pass** with `--no-check`
- **Parser integration**: SWC WASM fully functional
- **All extractors working**: Functions, comments, imports, exports, types, constants, violations
- **Monadic error handling**: Result/Validation properly implemented throughout
- **Constitutional compliance**: Curried functions, no arrows, no loops, no mutations, no classes
- **Operator substitutions Batch 1-4**: 22/35 files with `===` replaced by `isEqual()`

### ðŸ”§ What Needs Fixing

**Critical (Blocks `deno task test` without --no-check)**:
1. 6 TypeScript errors
2. 8 lint warnings

**In Progress (Batches 5-13)**:
3. Continue operator substitutions (`||`, `.length`, `!`, etc.)

## Notes for Future AIs

### READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE STARTING ANY BATCH:

1. **Tests Pass**: This library WORKS. All 188 tests pass. Don't believe old docs that say it's broken.

2. **Batch Order Matters**: Complete Batch 0 before moving to any other batch. Complete Batch 0.5 before Batch 5. Work sequentially.

3. **Unused Imports**: REMOVE them completely. Do NOT prefix with underscore. Just DELETE the unused import names.

4. **No Batch is Complete Until**: ALL verification steps pass (tests, lint, type check, checklist updated, committed).

5. **Verification Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Run these after EVERY batch:
   deno task test              # Must show 188/188 passing
   deno check src/             # Must show 0 errors
   deno lint src/              # Must show 0 errors
   ```

6. **Update Checklist**: Mark items [x] as you complete them. This document is your progress tracker.

7. **Commit Frequently**: One commit per batch. Include code changes AND checklist updates in same commit.

8. **Use search_files**: Find operator instances with correct regex before starting each batch.

9. **Import Paths**: All Toolsmith functions import from `@sitebender/toolsmith/<category>/<function>/index.ts`

10. **Don't Skip Verification**: Run all three verification commands after each batch. NO EXCEPTIONS.
