# Arborist Proof of Concept

This folder contains proof-of-concept scripts to verify that external dependencies work correctly.

## deno_ast_poc.ts

**Purpose**: Verify that @deco/deno-ast-wasm library loads and can parse TypeScript code for semantic analysis.

**Result**: âœ… SUCCESS - The library loads, parses TypeScript code, and returns proper AST structures with type information, function declarations, parameters, and return types.

**Command to run**:

```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-net deno_ast_poc.ts
```

**Output shows**:

- Library imports successfully
- parse() function returns a Promise that resolves to ParsedSource
- AST contains proper Module structure with body statements
- Function declarations include type annotations, parameters, return types
- Semantic analysis capabilities are available

This confirms that real semantic analysis can be implemented in Arborist using @deco/deno-ast-wasm, replacing the mock implementations.
