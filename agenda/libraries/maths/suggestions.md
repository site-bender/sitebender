## Suggestions and notes â€” Maths

- Parser/IR bridge
  - Emit Engine operator nodes directly (Op.Add/Multiply/etc.) rather than a bespoke config shape.
- Safety
  - Include depth/size guardrails in the parser to avoid pathological inputs.
- Tooling
  - Ship a REPL page in Playground for formula compile + IR preview.
