## @sitebender/toolkit — The Self-Building Mathematical Foundation

### Revolutionary Approach: The Test Generator Strategy

The toolkit is evolving from a hand-crafted library to a **self-building system**. Instead of manually writing tests for 874 functions (480+ hours), we're building a test generator that creates comprehensive test suites automatically (2 weeks to build, minutes to run).

### Core Philosophy

**Zero dependencies. Maximum power. Mathematical truth. Automated verification.**

The toolkit provides 874 pure functional building blocks, but more importantly, it provides:
- **Automatic test generation** from type signatures and algebraic laws
- **100% guaranteed coverage** through systematic branch analysis
- **Mathematical proof** via property-based testing
- **Self-documentation** through living examples

### The Test Generator Architecture

```typescript
// From this function signature:
<A, B>(f: (a: A) => B) => (xs: A[]) => B[]

// The generator automatically creates:
- Property tests (length preservation, composition, identity)
- Edge case tests (empty, null, undefined, single element)
- Branch coverage tests (every if/else path)
- Algebraic law tests (functor laws, etc.)
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation examples
```

### Current State (September 2025)

- **874 functions** implemented across 23 categories
- **15.5% test coverage** (THIS IS THE CRISIS)
- **Good JSDoc coverage** on most functions
- **Monadic types exist** but need unification
- **No test generator yet** (THIS IS THE SOLUTION)

### The Three-Phase Master Plan

#### Phase 1: Build the Machine (2 weeks) [IMMEDIATE]
1. **Test Generator** - Automatically generates all test cases
2. **Algebraic Law Suite** - Reusable law verification
3. **Coverage Validator** - Ensures 100% coverage with explicit ignores

#### Phase 2: Unify & Optimize (4 weeks)
1. **Monadic Unification** - One Result type to rule them all
2. **Toolkit Compiler** - Optimization and code generation
3. **Function Reduction** - 874 → 400 core + 474 derived

#### Phase 3: Deploy & Scale (4 weeks)
1. **Run Test Generator** - Achieve 100% coverage automatically
2. **Generate Chainable Layer** - Via compiler, not manual coding
3. **Living Documentation** - Self-documenting from tests

### Why This Works

**Traditional Approach**: 480 hours writing tests manually
**Revolutionary Approach**: 80 hours building tools + 0 hours manual testing

The test generator doesn't just save time - it guarantees:
- **Systematic coverage** - No human can miss branches
- **Algebraic correctness** - Laws are verified, not hoped for
- **Edge case discovery** - Automatic, not accidental
- **Documentation generation** - Examples from actual tests

### Integration Points

The toolkit serves as the foundation for:
- **@sitebender/engine** — Uses toolkit for calculations
- **@sitebender/components** — Uses toolkit for transformations
- **@sitebender/maths** — Will compile expressions to toolkit calls
- **@sitebender/distributed** — Will use toolkit for CRDTs
- **All scripts and tools** — Built on toolkit primitives

### The Test Generator Specification

```typescript
interface TestGenerator {
  // Parse function signature and implementation
  analyze(fn: Function): Analysis
  
  // Generate comprehensive test suite
  generateTests(analysis: Analysis): TestSuite
  
  // Verify 100% coverage
  verifyCoverage(tests: TestSuite): CoverageReport
  
  // Add explicit ignores where needed
  addIgnores(uncovered: Line[], reasons: string[]): void
}
```

### Success Metrics

- **100% reported test coverage** (or explicit ignores with reasons)
- **Zero manual test writing** after generator is built
- **Algebraic laws verified** for all applicable functions
- **Performance benchmarks** for every function
- **Living documentation** generated from tests

### The Revelation

We're not building a utility library. We're building:
1. A mathematical foundation (the functions)
2. A proof system (the test generator)
3. A compiler (optimization and code generation)
4. A living specification (self-documenting)

This is the path to mathematical truth through automation.
