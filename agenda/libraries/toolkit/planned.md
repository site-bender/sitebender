## @sitebender/toolkit — The Revolutionary Plan

### Phase 0: Build the Test Generator [2 weeks] — IMMEDIATE PRIORITY

This changes EVERYTHING. Instead of 480 hours of manual test writing, we build a machine that does it automatically.

#### Week 1: Core Generator Infrastructure

**Day 1-2: Type Signature Parser**

- [ ] Parse TypeScript function signatures
- [ ] Extract parameter types and return types
- [ ] Identify generic type parameters
- [ ] Detect optional parameters and defaults

**Day 3-4: Property Test Generator**

- [ ] Generate inputs based on types (number, string, array, etc.)
- [ ] Create property assertions from signatures
- [ ] Implement fast-check generators for all types
- [ ] Add shrinking for minimal failing cases

**Day 5-6: Algebraic Law Detector**

- [ ] Identify function patterns (map-like, fold-like, monoid, etc.)
- [ ] Map patterns to applicable laws
- [ ] Generate law-based test suites
- [ ] Create reusable law testers

**Day 7: Integration & Validation**

- [ ] Integrate components
- [ ] Test on sample functions
- [ ] Validate generated tests compile and run
- [ ] Fix edge cases

#### Week 2: Coverage Guarantee System

**Day 8-9: AST Parser for Branch Analysis**

- [ ] Parse function implementations
- [ ] Identify all conditional branches
- [ ] Map code paths through function
- [ ] Calculate inputs needed for each path

**Day 10-11: Branch Coverage Generator**

- [ ] Generate specific inputs for each branch
- [ ] Handle null checks and type guards
- [ ] Cover error paths and edge cases
- [ ] Ensure every line is reached

**Day 12: Coverage Validator**

- [ ] Run tests with Deno coverage
- [ ] Identify uncovered lines
- [ ] Attempt additional test generation
- [ ] Report truly unreachable code

**Day 13: Automatic Ignore Injector**

- [ ] Add `deno-coverage-ignore` to unreachable lines
- [ ] Include specific reasons for each ignore
- [ ] Generate coverage report
- [ ] Validate 100% reported coverage

**Day 14: Full Toolkit Run**

- [ ] Run generator on all 874 functions
- [ ] Fix any generator bugs found
- [ ] Achieve 100% coverage
- [ ] Generate comprehensive report

### Phase 1: Quick Wins [1 week]

While the test generator runs, fix these easy issues:

#### Immediate Fixes

- [ ] Add Future type alias for Task
- [ ] Consolidate type locations
- [ ] Add missing Writer monad functions
- [ ] Fix JSDoc examples where missing
- [ ] Add dependency injection to time functions

#### Monadic Unification Prep

- [ ] Document overlaps between Either/Result/Maybe
- [ ] Design unified Result type
- [ ] Plan migration strategy
- [ ] Create type aliases for compatibility

### Phase 2: The Compiler [4 weeks]

Build the toolkit compiler for optimization and code generation.

#### Week 3-4: Compiler Core

- [ ] AST parser for toolkit functions
- [ ] Dependency graph builder
- [ ] Type inference engine
- [ ] Code generation framework

#### Week 5-6: Optimizations

- [ ] Function composition fusion
- [ ] Automatic memoization injection
- [ ] Dead code elimination
- [ ] Bundle size optimization
- [ ] Lazy evaluation transforms

#### Generated Artifacts

- [ ] Chainable layer (auto-generated from simple)
- [ ] Derived functions (474 from 400 core)
- [ ] Type definitions
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Phase 3: Mathematical Unification [2 weeks]

#### Week 7: Monadic Consolidation

- [ ] Implement unified Result<T, E> type
- [ ] Migrate Either to Result
- [ ] Make Maybe = Result<T, null>
- [ ] Update all dependent code
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

#### Week 8: Function Reduction

- [ ] Identify 400 core functions
- [ ] Mark 474 as derivable
- [ ] Implement derivation rules
- [ ] Generate derived functions
- [ ] Validate equivalence

### Phase 4: Living Documentation [2 weeks]

#### Week 9: Documentation Engine

- [ ] Extract examples from tests
- [ ] Generate API docs from JSDoc
- [ ] Build interactive playground
- [ ] Create visual pipeline builder

#### Week 10: Performance Dashboard

- [ ] Benchmark all functions
- [ ] Track bundle size impact
- [ ] Memory usage profiling
- [ ] Comparison with native methods
- [ ] Optimization recommendations

### Timeline Summary

**Total Time:** 10 weeks (vs 6 months manual approach)

- Weeks 1-2: Test generator
- Week 3: Quick fixes
- Weeks 4-7: Compiler
- Weeks 8-9: Unification
- Weeks 10-11: Documentation

### The Revolutionary Outcome

By Week 11, we'll have:

1. **100% tested toolkit** (via automation)
2. **Optimizing compiler** (for performance)
3. **Unified type system** (one mental model)
4. **Living documentation** (self-maintaining)
5. **400 core + 474 derived functions** (maintainable)

### The Paradigm Shift

We're not writing tests. We're building a machine that writes tests.
We're not writing documentation. We're building a machine that writes documentation.
We're not optimizing code. We're building a machine that optimizes code.

**This is the way.**
