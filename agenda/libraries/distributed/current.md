## Distributed â€” current

Status

- Strategy drafted in agenda-old: IPFS-backed hybrid, local cache, optional WASM SPARQL; SSR-first reads.
- Infra present: Caddy TLS, Prometheus/Thanos, Grafana, MinIO, Fuseki. Labs in `web3-lab` cover experiments.

Gaps

- No formal adapter contracts in repo yet; injector `From.SPARQL` not implemented in Engine.
- Data layout and retention policies not codified.
