# Converting JSON to TTL (Turtle) and back

There are several ways to convert between JSON and Turtle (TTL), which is a format for representing RDF (Resource Description Framework) data. The conversion process typically involves interpreting JSON data as structured linked data, often using JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data) as an intermediate step. Below is a summary of methods and tools for both directions of conversion, along with key considerations.

### üîß 1. **JSON to Turtle Conversion**

- **Using JSON-LD Context**: The most standardized approach is to first define a `@context` in your JSON data to map JSON properties to RDF vocabularies (e.g., [schema.org](https://schema.org/), custom ontologies). This converts JSON into JSON-LD, which can then be serialized to Turtle using JavaScript libraries (e.g., `jsonld.js` for expansion/framing and `n3` for Turtle serialization).
  - Example JSON-LD context:
    ```json
    {
      "@context": {
        "name": "http://schema.org/name",
        "age": "http://schema.org/age"
      },
      "name": "Bart Simpson",
      "age": 11
    }
    ```
- **Direct Conversion Tools**: For JSON without pre-defined context, utilities can mechanically convert JSON keys to RDF predicates (using a base URI you provide). This generates Turtle with blank nodes for nested structures and is best treated as an import utility rather than the primary path.
- **Programmatic Methods**:
  - JavaScript: Use [`jsonld.js` (Digital Bazaar)](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js) or [`rdflib.js`](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js) to serialize JSON-LD to Turtle .
  - Java: [Apache Jena's `Model` API](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/javadoc/jena/org.apache.jena.core/org/apache/jena/rdf/model/Model.html) can read JSON-LD and write Turtle.
  - Ruby: The `rdf` gem CLI can serialize JSON-LD to Turtle .

### üîÑ 2. **Turtle to JSON Conversion**

- **Via JSON-LD**: Most tools convert Turtle to JSON-LD first, which is a JSON-based RDF serialization. Prefer JavaScript libraries (`n3`, `jsonld.js`) in CI to parse Turtle and serialize to JSON-LD.
- **Custom Transformation**: If you need non-JSON-LD JSON (e.g., simpler structure), you may need post-processing with tools like `jq` or custom scripts to reshape the data.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. **Key Considerations**

- **Vocabulary Mapping**: For meaningful RDF, define or reuse existing vocabularies (e.g., schema.org, Dublin Core) rather than inventing new properties .
- **Data Loss**: Converting arbitrary JSON to Turtle may flatten structures into triples (using blank nodes), and converting back might not perfectly reconstruct the original JSON. **QUESTION: How can we avoid this problem?**
- **Tool Compatibility**: Some tools (e.g., `jsonld2rdf`) expect JSON-LD input, while others (e.g., JSON2RDF) work with any JSON but require a base URI.

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. **Recommended Tools**

- **Online Converters**:
  - EasyRDF Converter (supports JSON-LD ‚Üî Turtle) .
- **Command-Line Tools**:
  - Node-based scripts using `jsonld.js` + `n3` for conversions.
- **Libraries**:
  - JavaScript: `jsonld.js`, `rdflib.js` .
  - Java: Apache Jena, RDF4J.
  - Python: `rdflib`.

### üìã 5. **Example Workflow**

- **JSON to Turtle**:
  1.  Add a `@context` to JSON to create JSON-LD.
  2.  Use a Node-based script to expand/compact with `jsonld.js` and serialize to Turtle with `n3`.
- **Turtle to JSON**:
  1.  Parse Turtle with `n3`, serialize to JSON-LD, and frame/compact with `jsonld.js`.
  2.  Optionally remove or simplify the `@context` if plain JSON is needed.

### üí° 6. **When to Use Which**

- **Use JSON-LD** if you want semantic interoperability and linked data compliance.
- **Use direct tools like JSON2RDF** for quick conversion without modifying JSON structure.
- **For round-tripping**, ensure your JSON data is compatible with RDF (e.g., avoid non-atomic values) to avoid data loss.

For our purposes, **JSON-LD with a well-designed context** is the recommended approach for seamless conversion between JSON and Turtle while avoiding Java-only tooling.
