# @sitebender/engine Library Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The `@sitebender/engine` library is a sophisticated reactive computation and SSR/hydration system with a declarative configuration-based architecture. While the core constructor system is largely complete and well-designed, the library faces critical issues with JSX integration, test coverage, and production readiness that need immediate attention.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Well-Architected Constructor System**: The library has a comprehensive set of 110+ constructor functions following consistent patterns across operators (47), comparators (~50), injectors (10), formatters (1), and logical operators (2).

2. **Type System Properly Configured**: OPERAND_TYPES constants are correctly defined with `comparator`, `logical`, `operator`, and `injector` types. The recent fixes have addressed the type issues mentioned in the README.

3. **Modern Context and State Management**: The library includes a proper ComposeContext implementation with environment detection, event bus (local/broadcast), logging, and signal support for cancellation.

4. **Registry Architecture Implemented**: Operations registries exist for operators, comparators, injectors, events, actions, and policies, providing a clean mapping system without dynamic imports.

5. **Zero Dependencies**: Adheres strictly to the project's zero-dependency philosophy with all functionality self-contained.

6. **Progressive Enhancement Ready**: SSR rendering pipeline exists with hydration support, though incomplete.

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Missing JSX Layer

**Problem**: The JSX-to-IR transformation layer is completely missing. While the README mentions JSX components, there are NO JSX component files in the expected location (`lib/components/engine/`). The components/index.tsx file just re-exports from @sitebender/components.

**Impact**: Developers cannot use the declarative JSX syntax advertised in the documentation. The entire promise of "JSX → IR → HTML" is broken.

**Required Fix**: 
- Create JSX component wrappers for all 110+ constructors
- Implement JSX-to-IR transformer
- Integrate with build pipeline

#### 2. Import Path Breakage

**Problem**: The file `src/constructors/elements/types/index.ts` has an invalid import:
```typescript
import type { ... } from "@sitebender/engine-types/index.ts"
```
This breaks test execution and likely other imports.

**Impact**: Tests cannot run, type checking fails.

**Required Fix**: Change to relative import path.

#### 3. Abysmal Test Coverage

**Problem**: Only 43 test files exist for 639 source files. The README admits "~1% coverage for operations" with only 1 test for 122 operation files.

**Impact**: No safety net for changes, no confidence in production readiness.

**Required Areas Needing Tests**:
- All 47 operators
- All ~50 comparators  
- All 10 injectors
- All formatters
- Rendering pipeline
- Hydration logic
- Context and state management
- Error handling paths

#### 4. Incomplete Rendering Pipeline

**Problem**: While SSR foundations exist, key pieces are missing:
- No unified SSR/CSR entry point in `rendering/index.ts`
- `embedIr.ts` is a stub (269 bytes)
- Hydration wiring incomplete
- No anchor resolution for behaviors

**Impact**: Cannot achieve the promised "SSR → Hydration" flow.

### Architectural Observations

#### 1. File Organization Issues

The library violates the project's "one function per file" rule in many places:
- Multiple type definitions per file
- Helper functions bundled together
- Constants files with dozens of exports

This inconsistency makes the codebase harder to navigate and contradicts CLAUDE.md principles.

#### 2. Type Safety Gaps

Several areas show incomplete typing:
- TODO comments about narrowing HTML element types
- Missing Temporal API type integration
- Loose `unknown[]` and `any` types in places
- Incomplete ARIA type definitions

#### 3. Missing Formatters

Only ONE formatter exists (`AsMonetaryAmount`) despite the system being designed for many:
- Missing date/time formatters
- Missing number formatters
- Missing string formatters
- Missing custom formatters

#### 4. Documentation Void

The library has:
- Minimal inline documentation
- No comprehensive API documentation
- Tutorial exists but is likely outdated given missing features
- No migration guide from constructors to JSX

### Performance Concerns

1. **No Optimization Strategy**: No evidence of performance testing or optimization
2. **No Caching Layer**: Calculations re-run unnecessarily
3. **No Memoization**: Repeated computations not cached
4. **Bundle Size Unknown**: No size analysis or tree-shaking verification

### Security & Privacy Issues

1. **No Input Sanitization**: User inputs passed directly to operations
2. **No CSP Considerations**: Script injection via calculations possible
3. **Local Storage Access**: No encryption or validation of stored data
4. **No Rate Limiting**: Calculations can run unbounded

## What's Broken

### Immediate Blockers (Cannot Ship)

1. **Import path errors** preventing any code execution
2. **Missing JSX transformation** breaking the entire developer experience  
3. **No working examples** or proof the system works end-to-end
4. **Test infrastructure broken** with import errors

### Functional Gaps

1. **Hydration incomplete** - client-side reactivity won't work
2. **Event handling missing** - no way to wire user interactions
3. **Validation system incomplete** - form validation broken
4. **Conditional rendering broken** - display logic not wired up

### Quality Issues

1. **Error handling inconsistent** - mix of Either/Result patterns
2. **No error recovery** - failures cascade without graceful degradation
3. **Debug tooling absent** - no way to inspect calculation graphs
4. **Performance unmeasured** - no benchmarks or profiling

## What Could Be Done Better

### 1. Adopt Test-First Development

Before writing more features:
- Establish 100% coverage baseline for existing code
- Use property-based testing for mathematical operations
- Create integration test suite for SSR/hydration flow
- Add visual regression tests for rendered output

### 2. Complete the JSX Story

The hybrid constructor/JSX approach needs resolution:
- Either fully commit to JSX with proper tooling
- Or abandon JSX and focus on constructor ergonomics
- Current half-state serves no one well

### 3. Implement Proper Modularization

- Split into smaller, focused packages:
  - `@sitebender/engine-core` - IR and evaluation
  - `@sitebender/engine-constructors` - Constructor functions
  - `@sitebender/engine-react` - JSX components
  - `@sitebender/engine-ssr` - Server rendering
  - `@sitebender/engine-hydrate` - Client hydration

### 4. Add Developer Tools

- IR visualizer/debugger
- Calculation graph inspector  
- Performance profiler
- Error boundary components
- Development mode with helpful warnings

### 5. Establish Clear Boundaries

- Separate runtime from build-time code
- Clear server vs client code paths
- Explicit public API surface
- Internal vs external types

## What Needs to Be Done

### Phase 1: Stop the Bleeding (Week 1)

1. **Fix all import paths** - Make tests runnable
2. **Add smoke tests** - Verify basic functionality works
3. **Document current state** - What works, what doesn't
4. **Create working example** - Proof of concept app

### Phase 2: Foundation Repair (Week 2-3)

1. **Implement JSX components** for top 20 most-used constructors
2. **Fix hydration flow** - Get client-side reactivity working
3. **Add integration tests** - SSR → Hydration → Interaction flow
4. **Establish error boundaries** - Prevent cascade failures

### Phase 3: Fill Critical Gaps (Week 4-5)

1. **Complete remaining JSX components** (90+ remaining)
2. **Add missing formatters** (10+ needed)
3. **Implement validation system** properly
4. **Wire up conditional display** logic

### Phase 4: Production Hardening (Week 6-8)

1. **Achieve 80% test coverage** minimum
2. **Add performance benchmarks** and optimization
3. **Implement security measures** - sanitization, CSP
4. **Create comprehensive documentation**

### Phase 5: Developer Experience (Week 9-10)

1. **Build developer tools** - debugger, profiler
2. **Create component playground** 
3. **Write migration guide**
4. **Add TypeScript plugin** for better DX

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Halt new feature development** until foundation is solid
2. **Focus on test coverage** - aim for 100% on critical paths
3. **Fix the JSX layer** or remove JSX references from docs
4. **Create real-world example** to validate the architecture

### Strategic Decisions Needed

1. **JSX vs Constructors**: Pick one as primary, other as secondary
2. **Monolith vs Modular**: Current structure is too large
3. **Runtime vs Compile**: Clarify what happens when
4. **Framework Integration**: How does this work with React/Vue/Svelte?

### Technical Debt to Address

1. **Replace dynamic imports** with explicit registries (partially done)
2. **Unify error handling** - pick Either or Result, not both
3. **Standardize file organization** - follow one-function-per-file
4. **Remove all TODOs** - implement or document why not

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Production deployment** would likely fail immediately
- **No fallback** for calculation failures
- **Memory leaks** possible in event subscriptions
- **Type safety** not guaranteed at runtime

### Medium Risk  

- **Performance degradation** under load untested
- **Browser compatibility** unknown
- **Accessibility** compliance unverified
- **Security vulnerabilities** uninvestigated

### Low Risk

- **Developer adoption** blocked by missing features
- **Documentation debt** growing with each change
- **Technical drift** from intended architecture

## Conclusion

The @sitebender/engine library has a solid architectural foundation and innovative approach to reactive UI construction. However, it is currently in a pre-alpha state with critical missing pieces that prevent it from being usable in any production capacity.

The most pressing issues are:
1. Complete absence of the JSX layer despite being prominently featured
2. Near-zero test coverage providing no safety net
3. Broken imports preventing basic functionality
4. Incomplete SSR/hydration story

The library needs approximately 10 weeks of focused development to reach a minimally viable state, with the first 3 weeks being critical for establishing a working foundation.

### Bottom Line

**Current State**: Innovative but incomplete, promising but unproven
**Production Ready**: No - multiple critical blockers
**Estimated Time to MVP**: 10 weeks with focused effort
**Recommendation**: Pause feature work, fix foundations first

The vision is compelling and the architecture is sound, but execution has fallen short of the ambitious goals. With disciplined effort focused on the basics - tests, documentation, and core functionality - this could become the powerful, zero-dependency reactive engine it aspires to be.
