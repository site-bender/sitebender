# Plan: Worktrees workflow

## Goals
- Safe, simple parallel sessions with good hygiene.

## Deliverables
- Hardened setup/run scripts; docs; guardrails against data loss.

## Steps
1. Update scripts to bail on uncommitted changes; show status across trees.
2. Add helpers: list branches/worktrees, clean stale dirs.
3. Document usage and pitfalls.
