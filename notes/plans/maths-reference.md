# Plan: Maths reference and parser alignment

## Goals
- Align reference with the parserâ€™s supported operations and precedence.
- Provide clear numeric semantics.

## Deliverables
- Reference doc with precedence/associativity, function arity, and examples.
- Tests derived from reference examples.

## Steps
1. Draft precedence table and supported functions list.
2. Document integer/decimal behavior and rounding strategy.
3. Add examples and convert to behavioral/integrated/property-based tests.
